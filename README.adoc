Five Apache projects you probably didn't know about (2023-12-17)::
In early 2021, I started to work on the Apache APISIX project. I have to admit that I had never heard about it before. In this post, I&#8217;d like to introduce some Apache projects that are less well-known than HTTPD or Kafka.   Apache APISIX    APISIX is an API Gateway. It builds upon OpenResty, a Lua layer built on top of the famous nginx reverse-proxy. APISIX adds abstractions to the mix, e.g., Route, Service, Upstream, and offers a plugin-based architecture.   Lots of plugins are provided ou[...]

Apache APISIX plugin priority, a leaky abstraction? (2023-12-10)::
Apache APISIX is an API Gateway, which builds upon the OpenResty reverse-proxy to offer a plugin-based architecture. The main benefit of such an architecture is that it brings structure to the configuration of routes. It&#8217;s a help at scale, when managing hundreds or thousands of routes.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to describe how plugins, priority, and phases play together and what pitfalls you must be aware of.   APISIX plugin&#8217;s priority   When you configure a route with multiple p[...]

Canary releases with Apache APISIX (2023-12-03)::
In a few words, the idea of canary releases is to deliver a new software version to only a fraction of the users, analyze the results, and decide whether to proceed further or not. If results are not aligned with expectations, roll back; if they are, increase the number of users exposed until all users benefit from the new version.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to detail this introduction briefly, explain different ways to define the fraction, and show how to execute it with Apache APISIX.   Int[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
