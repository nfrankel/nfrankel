Random and fixed routes with Apache APISIX (2024-06-09)::
My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at Apache APISIX. Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:     We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I&#8217;ll give an example for better understanding.   We have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html a[...]

Even more Opentelemetry! (2024-06-02)::
I continue to work on my Opentelemetry demo. Its main idea is to showcase traces across various technology stacks, including asynchronous communication via an MQTT queue. This week, I added a couple of components and changed the architecture. Here are some noteworthy learnings; note that some of them might not be entirely connected to OpenTelemetry.   Here&#8217;s an updated diagram. New components appear in violet, and updated components appear in green.        I want to be able to add more comp[...]

Parsing structured environment variables in Rust (2024-05-26)::
I&#8217;m in the process of adding more components to my OpenTelemetry demo (again!). The new design deploys several warehouse services behind the inventory service so the latter can query the former for data via their respective HTTP interface. I implemented each warehouse on top of a different technology stack. This way, I can show OpenTelemetry traces across several stacks.   Anyone should be able to add a warehouse in their favorite tech stack if it returns the correct JSON payload to the inv[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.       



https://www.javaday.org.ua/program-2024-offline[An always up-to-date developer's CV^] @ http://javaday.org.ua/[JavaDay^]::

It‚Äôs been said that GitHub is a developer‚Äôs CV. Just a quick look at your commit history and recruiters know all about you. There are a couple of issues with this approach. Most companies don‚Äôt even publish their source code under an Open Source license. If you work for one of them, and if you‚Äôre not a rabid Open Source developer, then it‚Äôs obviously not helpful. Recently, GitHub allowed some degree of customization of one‚Äôs profile. So, even if your commit history has more white than green, you can provide a good entry-point for potential employers. But it‚Äôs only as good as the effort you put in it, and it might decay fast. Yet, with a bit of work, and the help of automation tools (such as GitHub Actions), you can provide an always up-to-date profile. In this talk, I‚Äôll present you how to do it, using my own setup as an example.- conference: devconfcz

On dit que les donn√©es sont le nouveau p√©trole. Pour connecter des syst√®mes h√©t√©rog√®nes, le standard de facto est est les APIs HTTP. Mais aucune entreprise ne se permet d'exposer directement son syst√®me d'information √† l'ext√©rieur. Vous avez besoin d'un point d'entr√©e central pour g√©rer les probl√©matiques transversales comme l'authentification et une liste noire d'adresses IP, mais aussi la limitation du d√©bit et le d√©ploiement canari. Dans cet atelier, nous utiliserons Apache APISIX (sur Docker) pour montrer quelques capacit√©s qui peuvent aider votre syst√®me d'information √† faire face aux d√©fis introduits par les APIs. * Routage de vos appels vers le bon Upstream * Les abstractions disponibles : Route, Upstream, Service * Le tableau de bord Apache APISIX * Configurer APISIX avec le tableau de bord * Configurer APISIX avec la ligne de commande * Surveillance d'APISIX * Introduction au d√©veloppement de plugins en Lua
