Using my new Raspberry Pi to run an existing GitHub Action (2024-03-10)::
Recently, I mentioned how I refactored the script that kept my GitHub profile up-to-date. Since Geecon Prague, I&#8217;m also a happy owner of a Raspberry Pi:  Guess what I won @GeeCON Prague? üòé pic.twitter.com/b9dARUhfMd&mdash; Nicolas Frankel üá∫üá¶ (@nicolas_frankel) October 20, 2023     Though the current setup works flawlessly - and is free, I wanted to experiment with self-hosted runners. Here are my findings.   Context   GitHub offers a large free usage of GitHub Actions:     GitHub Actions us[...]

From Kotlin Scripting to Python (2024-03-03)::
GitHub offers a way to customize one&#8217;s profile by allowing one to create a README in a specific repository, named as your profile, e.g., nfrankel/nfrankel. A couple of years ago, I automated the update of my GitHub profile with up-to-date info: my latest blog posts, my upcoming talks, and the last recorded YouTube talk. I took the time to document how to do it on this blog.   At the time, I chose Kotlin scripting because I was proficient enough in Kotlin, but I wanted to learn the scripting[...]

Secure your API with these 16 Practices with Apache APISIX - part 2 (2024-02-25)::
Last week, we listed 16 practices to help secure one&#8217;s APIs and described how to implement them with Apache APISIX.    Authentication üïµÔ∏èÔ∏è - Verifies the identity of users accessing APIs.Authorization üö¶ - Determines permissions of authenticated users.Data Redaction üñçÔ∏è - Obscures sensitive data for protection.Encryption üîí - Encodes data so only authorized parties can decode it.Error Handling ‚ùå - Manages responses when things go wrong, avoiding revealing sensitive info.Input Validation &amp; D[...]

## üó£Ô∏è Upcoming talks



https://dodkrakow.pl/bio/#id=54864[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://dodkrakow.pl/[DevOpsDays Krakow^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.       



https://indico.cern.ch/event/1366825/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://home.cern/[Centre Europ√©en de Recherche Nucl√©aire^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
