Problem Details for HTTP APIs - RFC 7807 is dead, long live RFC 9457 (2023-09-10)::
The positive experience of RFC 7807, whose journey began in 2016, is concluded (deprecation) but also confirmed with a new official proposition: the RFC 9457. The changes made are small but it is a suitable opportunity to analyze the evolution of this topic. Context The RFC 7807, and now the RFC 9457 which perfects it, was born after a period in which the Internet Companies have made it clear that the integration of the business, the eventual transformation of the company services into a plat[...]

Offering my blog to new authors (2023-09-03)::
Regular readers of this blog know that I started it a long time ago, namely in April 2008. I soon found my cruising speed: a post a week. It requires time and discipline, but I achieved this goal during all those years. However, while I still have enough of both, I start to miss good post ideas. There are several reasons for this. I‚Äôve always told that working on real-world projects is a vast source of ideas. Moving to Developer Advocacy, I‚Äôve widened the list of topics I‚Äôm fa[...]

Send your logs to Loki (2023-08-27)::
One of my current talks focuses on Observability in general and Distributed Tracing in particular, with an OpenTelemetry implementation. In the demo, I show how you can see the traces of a simple distributed system consisting of: the Apache APISIX API Gateway, a Kotlin app with Spring Boot, a Python app with Flask, and a Rust app with Axum. Earlier this year, I spoke and attended the Observability room at FOSDEM. One of the talks demoed the Grafana stack: Mimir for metrics, Tempo for traces, and [...]

https://devopsstage.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel-2/[Back to basics, getting traffic into your Kubernetes cluster^] @ https://devopsstage.com/[DevOps Stage^]::
+
However you're using your Kubernetes cluster, you'll sooner or later need to direct traffic into it. At this point, you're spoiled with choice. Kubernetes provides no less than three different objects: NodePort, Ingress, and LoadBalancer. Of course, each of them comes with its limitations. For example, LoadBalancer requires a dedicated implementation provided by Cloud Platforms but not with most local distributions. Moreover, Kubernetes is introducing a new Gateway API, adding one more way to direct traffic to the cluster. In this talk, I'd like to offer an overview of all four options, with their pros and cons, and a more in-depth explanation of the new Gateway API.  


https://jugsaxony.org/day/programm/details/105[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://jug-saxony-day.org/[JUG Saxony Day^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.


https://bed-con.org/2023/programm[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ http://www.bed-con.org/[Berlin Expert Days^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
