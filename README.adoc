Comparing transitive dependency version resolution in Rust and Java (2025-09-14)::
You learn by comparing to what you already know. I was recently bitten by assuming Rust worked as Java regarding transitive dependency version resolution. In this post, I want to compare the two.   Dependencies, transitivity, and version resolution   Before diving into the specifics of each stack, let&#8217;s describe the domain and the problems that come with it.   When developing any project above Hello World level, chances are you&#8217;ll face problems that others have faced before. If the pr[...]

Clean Design, Strong Client: The way of the Elasticsearch's Java SDK (2025-09-07)::
Java has a vast ecosystem of APIs, not all of which are effective or easy to learn. Developing a good API is not trivial: misdesigning key elements, defining simple abstractions, and threading models are among the themes that must be addressed. The official Elasticsearch Java SDK is a project with a design effort that has been made to address these elements.   Recently, this project surprised me, and I tried to examine the design ideas that make it interesting and effective, while also having som[...]

Thoughts on object creation (2025-08-31)::
Creational patterns were first described in the famous Gang of Four&#8217;s Design Patterns. The book presents each pattern in a dedicated chapter and follows a strict structure for each one: intent, motivation, applicability, structure, participants, collaborations, consequences, implementation, sample codes, known uses, and related patterns. The intent pattern presents a succinct goal of the pattern, while the applicability tells when you should use it.   For example, here&#8217;s an excerpt fo[...]

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
