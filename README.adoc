Rust on the front-end (2021-07-04)::
This is the 5th post in the Start Rust focus series. Up until now, JavaScript has been the only ubiquitous language available in browsers. It has made JavaScript much more popular than its design (and its associated flaws) would have allowed. I don’t want to start a holy war about the merits of JavaScript, but IMHO, it only survived this far because of its role in browsers. In particular, the current architecture that moves the responsibility of executing the code from the server to the cli[...]

BlockHound: how it works (2021-06-20)::
One of the talks in my current portfolio is Migrating from Imperative to Reactive. The talk is based on a demo migrating from Spring WebMVC to Spring WebFlux in a step-by-step approach. One of the steps involves installing BlockHound: it allows to check whether a blocking call occurs in a thread it shouldn’t happen and throws an exception at runtime when it happens.

+
While Reactive Programming is very different from the usual Imperative way, there’s no denying it fits “the Cloud”, as every bit of resource is used to its fullest. Let’s see how to migrate from the latter to the former using a Spring Boot web app as an example.
