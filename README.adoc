WebAssembly on Kubernetes (2025-03-02)::
Like a couple of innovative technologies, different people have different viewpoints on where WebAssembly fits the technology landscape.     WebAssembly (also called Wasm) is certainly the subject of much hype right now. But what is it? Is it the JavaScript Killer? Is it a new programming language for the web? Is it (as we like to say) the next wave of cloud compute? We‚Äôve heard it called many things: a better eBPF, the alternative to RISC V, a competitor to Java (or Flash), a performance booster[...]

Pull request testing on Kubernetes: vCluster for isolation and costs control (2025-02-23)::
This week&#8217;s post is the third and final in my series about running tests on Kubernetes for each pull request. In the first post, I described the app and how to test locally using Testcontainers and in a GitHub workflow. The second post focused on setting up the target environment and running end-to-end tests on Kubernetes.   I concluded the latter by mentioning a significant quandary. Creating a dedicated cluster for each workflow significantly impacts the time it takes to run. On GKE, it t[...]

Pull Request testing on Kubernetes: working with GitHub Actions and GKE (2025-02-16)::
I&#8217;m continuing my series on running the test suite for each Pull Request on Kubernetes. In the previous post, I laid the groundwork for our learning journey: I developed a basic JVM-based CRUD app, tested it locally using Testcontainers, and tested it in a GitHub workflow with a GitHub service container.   This week, I will raise the ante to run the end-to-end test in the target Kubernetes environment. For this, I&#8217;ve identified gaps that I&#8217;ll implement in this blog post:  Create[...]

https://cloud-native-day-oslo-2025.sessionize.com/session/823793[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://oslo.cloudnativeday.no/[Cloud Native Day Oslo^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
