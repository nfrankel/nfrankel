Even more Opentelemetry! (2024-06-02)::
I continue to work on my Opentelemetry demo. Its main idea is to showcase traces across various technology stacks, including asynchronous communication via an MQTT queue. This week, I added a couple of components and changed the architecture. Here are some noteworthy learnings; note that some of them might not be entirely connected to OpenTelemetry.   Here&#8217;s an updated diagram. New components appear in violet, and updated components appear in green.        I want to be able to add more comp[...]

Parsing structured environment variables in Rust (2024-05-26)::
I&#8217;m in the process of adding more components to my OpenTelemetry demo (again!). The new design deploys several warehouse services behind the inventory service so the latter can query the former for data via their respective HTTP interface. I implemented each warehouse on top of a different technology stack. This way, I can show OpenTelemetry traces across several stacks.   Anyone should be able to add a warehouse in their favorite tech stack if it returns the correct JSON payload to the inv[...]

Workflow, from stateless to stateful (2024-05-19)::
A (long) time ago, my first job consisted of implementing workflows using the Staffware engine. In short, a workflow comprises tasks; an automated task delegates to code, while a manual task requires somebody to do something and mark it as done. Then, it proceeds to the next task - or tasks. Here&#8217;s a sample workflow:      The above diagram uses Business Process Model and Notation. You can now design your workflow using BPMN and run it with compatible workflow engines.   Time has passed. Sta[...]

https://2024.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/?id=HMQMDH[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://berlinbuzzwords.de/[Berlin Buzzwords^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
