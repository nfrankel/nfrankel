Workflow, from stateless to stateful (2024-05-19)::
A (long) time ago, my first job consisted of implementing workflows using the Staffware engine. In short, a workflow comprises tasks; an automated task delegates to code, while a manual task requires somebody to do something and mark it as done. Then, it proceeds to the next task - or tasks. Here&#8217;s a sample workflow:      The above diagram uses Business Process Model and Notation. You can now design your workflow using BPMN and run it with compatible workflow engines.   Time has passed. Sta[...]

My opinion on the Tauri framework (2024-05-12)::
I&#8217;ve always liked GUI, both desktop-based and browser-based before you needed five years of training on the latter. That&#8217;s the reason I loved, and still love Vaadin: you can develop web UIs without writing a single line of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I&#8217;m still interested in the subject; a couple of years ago, I analyzed the state of JVM desktop frameworks.   I also like the Rust programming language a lot.   Tauri is a Rust-based framework for building desktop applications. Here&[...]

The Vary HTTP header (2024-05-05)::
I try to constantly deepen my knowledge of HTTP and REST. Recently, I stumbled upon the list of all registered HTTP Headers. This post is dedicated to the Vary HTTP Header.   The problem   Two years ago, I wrote about web resource caching server-side. The idea is to set up a component between the client and the upstream to cache previously computed results to avoid overloading the latter. Depending on your infrastructure and requirements, this component can be a reverse proxy or an API Gateway. H[...]

+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.



https://jconeurope2024.sched.com/event/1YwRs[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.meetup.com/BruJUG/[Brussels Java User Group^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

Lorsque vous publiez votre premi√®re API HTTP, vous avez tendance √† vous concentrer davantage sur les probl√©matiques √† court terme que sur l'avenir. Cependant, il y a des chances que votre application rencontre du succ√®s. La question se pose alors : comment faire √©voluer votre API sans rompre le contrat avec vos utilisateurs existants ? Dans cette pr√©sentation, je vous montrerai quelques trucs et astuces pour y parvenir : d√©placer vos points de terminaison, les d√©pr√©cier, surveiller qui les utilise et informer les utilisateurs des nouveaux points de terminaison. La pr√©sentation est bas√©e sur une d√©mo et j'utiliserai le projet Apache APISIX pour cela.
