The pitfall of implicit returns (2024-03-17)::
Implicit returns are a feature in some languages. They have recently bitten me, so here&#8217;s my opinion.   Statements, expressions, and returns   Before diving into implicit returns, we must explain two programming concepts influencing them. A lot of literature is available on the subject, so I&#8217;ll paraphrase one of the existing definitions:     An expression usually refers to a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. In most programming languages, there are typically three differ[...]

Using my new Raspberry Pi to run an existing GitHub Action (2024-03-10)::
Recently, I mentioned how I refactored the script that kept my GitHub profile up-to-date. Since Geecon Prague, I&#8217;m also a happy owner of a Raspberry Pi:  Guess what I won @GeeCON Prague? üòé pic.twitter.com/b9dARUhfMd&mdash; Nicolas Frankel üá∫üá¶ (@nicolas_frankel) October 20, 2023     Though the current setup works flawlessly - and is free, I wanted to experiment with self-hosted runners. Here are my findings.   Context   GitHub offers a large free usage of GitHub Actions:     GitHub Actions us[...]

From Kotlin Scripting to Python (2024-03-03)::
GitHub offers a way to customize one&#8217;s profile by allowing one to create a README in a specific repository, named as your profile, e.g., nfrankel/nfrankel. A couple of years ago, I automated the update of my GitHub profile with up-to-date info: my latest blog posts, my upcoming talks, and the last recorded YouTube talk. I took the time to document how to do it on this blog.   At the time, I chose Kotlin scripting because I was proficient enough in Kotlin, but I wanted to learn the scripting[...]

https://indico.cern.ch/event/1366825/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://home.cern/[Centre Europ√©en de Recherche Nucl√©aire^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.



https://devopsdays.istanbul/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devopsdays.istanbul/[DevOps Days Istanbul^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.       



https://www.lambdaconf.us/speakers/nicolas-frankel[Make Your Security Policy Auditable^] @ https://www.lambdaconf.us/[Lambda Conf^]::
+
Nowadays, I believe that everybody realizes the importance of preventing undue access to one's applications. Many conceptual models are available, RBAC, ABAC, you name it. Likewise, all popular stacks have frameworks and libraries to help developers implement your chose policy access. If your organization only has a handful of apps, that's all fine and dandy, but problems appear at scale. One such problem is to keep under control access configuration across dozens or even hundreds of apps. It requires regular, if not continuous auditing: it's impossible to achieve when the configuration is code, even worse if it's a compiled language. Open Policy Agent aims to externalize such configuration in a text format with a specified semantics. In this presentation, I'll explain OPA in more details and demo how to migrate from regular Spring Boot application to an OPA-based approach in different steps.
