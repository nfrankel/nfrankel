One giant Kubernetes cluster for everything (2025-03-16)::
The ideal size of your Kubernetes clusters is a day 0 question and demands a definite answer.   You find one giant cluster on one end of the spectrum and many small-sized ones on the other, with every combination in between. This decision will impact your organization for years to come. Worse, if you decide to change your topology, you&#8217;re in for a time-wasting and expensive ride.   I want to list each approach&#8217;s pros and cons in this post. Then, I&#8217;ll settle the discussion once a[...]

Improving Maven's dependency:analyze... or not (2025-03-09)::
Recently, my good friend Richard Fichtner advised using the mvn dependency:analyze command to get rid of declared but unused dependencies:  There is another use case for  mvn dependency:analyze  It can show you the dependencies you use in your code but have not declared in your pom.xml. This works because you have a transitive dependency on your classpath. Either don&#x27;t use the dependency or declare it.[image or embed]&mdash; Richard Fichtner üíª‚òï (@richard.fichtner.dev) December 10, 2024 at 2:[...]

WebAssembly on Kubernetes (2025-03-02)::
Like a couple of innovative technologies, different people have different viewpoints on where WebAssembly fits the technology landscape.     WebAssembly (also called Wasm) is certainly the subject of much hype right now. But what is it? Is it the JavaScript Killer? Is it a new programming language for the web? Is it (as we like to say) the next wave of cloud compute? We‚Äôve heard it called many things: a better eBPF, the alternative to RISC V, a competitor to Java (or Flash), a performance booster[...]

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ljc-meet-up-at-couchbase-tickets-1277592175589[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/[London Java Community^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
