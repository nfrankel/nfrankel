Augmenting the client with HTMX (2024-10-06)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client to augment the latter. So far, I described the process with Vue.js and Alpine.js. Both are similar from the developers' point of view: they involve JavaScript.   In this post, I&#8217;ll focus on HTMX, whose approach is quite different.   Laying out the work   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as in the previous posts of the series. Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-s[...]

Augmenting the client with Alpine.js (2024-09-29)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client, which is colloquially known as AJAX. I dedicated the previous post to Vue.js; I&#8217;ll dedicate this one to Alpine.js - not to be confused with Alpine Linux.   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as previously.   Laying out the work   Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-side  Here is how I integrate Thymeleaf and Alpine.js in the POM:   pom.xml  &lt;dependencies&gt;   [...]

Augmenting the client with Vue.js (2024-09-22)::
In my previous post, I laid the ground to build upon; now is the time to start 'for real'.   I heard a lot of Vue.js. Additionally, a friend who transitioned from developer to manager told me good things about Vue, which further piqued my interest. I decided to have a look at it: it will be the first 'lightweight' JavaScript framework I&#8217;ll study - from the point of view of a newbie, which I am.   Laying out the work   I explained WebJars and Thymeleaf in the last post. Here&#8217;s the setu[...]

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.

Il est essentiel de suivre le parcours d'une requ√™te √† travers les diff√©rents composants d'un syst√®me distribu√©. Avec l'essor des microservices, cette fonctionnalit√© a atteint un niveau de criticit√© comme jamais auparant. Certains outils propri√©taires de suivi vous sont peut-√™tre connus : Jaeger et Zipkin viennent naturellement √† l'esprit. L'observabilit√© repose sur trois piliers : la journalisation, les m√©triques et le tra√ßage. OpenTelemetry est un effort conjoint visant √† mettre en place un standard ouvert pour ces trois piliers. Jaeger et Zipkin se sont joints √† cet effort et sont maintenant compatibles avec OpenTelemetry. Dans cet expos√©, je d√©crirai plus en d√©tail ce qui pr√©c√®de et je pr√©senterai un cas d'utilisation (simple) pour d√©montrer comment vous pourriez b√©n√©ficier des traces OpenTelemetry dans votre architecture distribu√©e.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
