Ops friendly Apache APISIX (2023-08-13)::
Though I always worked on the Dev side of IT, I was also interested in the Ops side. I even had a short experience being a WebSphere admin: I used it several times, helping Ops deal with the Admin console while being a developer. Providing a single package that Ops can configure and deploy in different environments is very important. As a JVM developer, I’ve been happy using Spring Boot and its wealth of configuration options: command-line parameters, JVM parameters, files, profiles, enviro[...]

My final take on Gradle (vs. Maven) (2023-08-06)::
I tweet technical content that I consider interesting, but the funny tweets are the ones that get the most engagement. I attended the JavaLand conference in March, stumbled upon the Gradle booth, and found this gem: Things have changed a lot 😂😂😂“When you can’t beat them, join them” pic.twitter.com/SnX3KN57o8— Nicolas Frankel 🇺🇦 (@nicolas_frankel) March 22, 2023 Of course, at some point, a fanboy hijacked the thread and claimed the so-called superiority of Gradle. In this post, I&#8217[...]

System architecture: move authentication to the API Gateway (2023-07-30)::
When exposing an application to the outside world, consider a Reverse-Proxy or an API Gateway to protect it from attacks. Rate Limiting comes to mind first, but it shouldn’t stop there. We can factor many features in the API Gateway and should be bold in moving them from our apps. In this post, I’ll show how to implement authentication at the Gateway API stage. Overall authentication flow The API Gateway doesn’t authenticate but delegates authentication to an authentication [...]

## 🗣️ Upcoming talks


https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-java-developers-meetup/events/294797711[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.meetup.com/charlotte-java-developers-meetup/[Charlotte JUG^]::
+
Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
However you're using your Kubernetes cluster, you'll sooner or later need to direct traffic into it. At this point, you're spoiled with choice. Kubernetes provides no less than three different objects: NodePort, Ingress, and LoadBalancer. Of course, each of them comes with its limitations. For example, LoadBalancer requires a dedicated implementation provided by Cloud Platforms but not with most local distributions. Moreover, Kubernetes is introducing a new Gateway API, adding one more way to direct traffic to the cluster. In this talk, I'd like to offer an overview of all four options, with their pros and cons, and a more in-depth explanation of the new Gateway API.
