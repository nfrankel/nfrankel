Five ways to pass parameters to Apache APISIX (2024-04-28)::
I recently read 6 Ways To Pass Parameters to Spring REST API. Though the title is a bit misleading, as it&#8217;s unrelated to REST, it does an excellent job listing all ways to send parameters to a Spring application. I want to do the same for Apache APISIX; it&#8217;s beneficial when you write a custom plugin.   General setup   The general setup uses Docker Compose and static configuration. I&#8217;ll have one plugin per way to pass parameters.   docker-compose.yml  services:   httpbin:     ima[...]

The try block in Rust (2024-04-21)::
I wrote previously about libs for error management in Rust. This week, I want to write about the try block, an experimental feature.   The limit of the ? operator   Please check the above article for a complete refresher on error management in general and the ? operator in particular. In short, ? allows to hook into a function call that returns a Result:  If the Result contains a value, it continues normallyIf it contains an error, it short-circuits and returns the Result to the calling function.[...]

Dissolving Design Patterns In Design Elements (2024-04-14)::
The book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software was one of the texts that changed how we think about software design. This book came out in 1994 through the efforts of Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, later remembered as Gang Of Four (GoF)   GoF Design Patterns: The Origin, the Impact   The book&#8217;s importance lies in its effort to review the software production done up at that moment, giving more structure to the concept of Software Design[...]

https://www.lambdaconf.us/speakers/nicolas-frankel[Make Your Security Policy Auditable^] @ https://www.lambdaconf.us/[Lambda Conf^]::
+
Nowadays, I believe that everybody realizes the importance of preventing undue access to one's applications. Many conceptual models are available, RBAC, ABAC, you name it. Likewise, all popular stacks have frameworks and libraries to help developers implement your chose policy access. If your organization only has a handful of apps, that's all fine and dandy, but problems appear at scale. One such problem is to keep under control access configuration across dozens or even hundreds of apps. It requires regular, if not continuous auditing: it's impossible to achieve when the configuration is code, even worse if it's a compiled language. Open Policy Agent aims to externalize such configuration in a text format with a specified semantics. In this presentation, I'll explain OPA in more details and demo how to migrate from regular Spring Boot application to an OPA-based approach in different steps.



https://events.geekle.us/wsas/[On-the-Fly Image Resizing, an Approach to Web Asset Management^] @ https://architecture.geekle.us/[Worldwide Software Architecture Summit^]::
+
One of the web architect’s main challenges is to tackle image optimization. The age-old approach is to deliberately create size variants of a single image to deliver the best user experience. It was a time-consuming task, which can be marginally improved with Machine Learning. In this session, I’ll offer a new approach that should both avoid this process and cut storage costs. Join me for practical insights into reducing expenses without compromising web performance.



https://jconeurope2024.sched.com/event/1YwRs[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ http://jcon.one/[JCON^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you’re more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you’ll be successful, and you’ll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I’ll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who’s using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I’ll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
