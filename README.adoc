GitLab as your Continuous Deployment one-stop shop (2021-08-01)::
This week, I want to take a break from my Start Rust series and focus on a different subject. I‚Äôve already written about my blogging stack in detail. However, I didn‚Äôt touch into one facet, and that facet is how I generate the static pages from Jekyll. As I describe in the blog post, I‚Äôve included quite a couple of customizations. Some of them require external dependencies, such as: A JRE for PlantUML diagrams generationThe graphviz package for the same reasonetc. All in all[...]

diceroller, a sample Rust project (2021-07-25)::
This is the 8th post in the Start Rust focus series. For me, the best learning process is switching regularly between learning and doing, theory and practice. The last post was research, hence, this one will be coding. I‚Äôve been a player of Role-Playing Games since I‚Äôm 11. Of course, I‚Äôve played Dungeons & Dragons (mainly the so-called Advanced Edition) but after a few years, I‚Äôve taken upon Champions and its HERO system. The system is based on points allotment and all[...]

Rust and the JVM (2021-07-18)::
This is the 7th post in the Start Rust focus series. So far, we have learned the basics of Rust syntax, developed a custom Kubernetes controller, and integrated with the front-end with Wasm. I‚Äôve been using the JVM for two decades now, mainly in Java. The JVM is an amazing piece of technology. IMHO, its biggest benefit is its ability to adapt the native code to the current workload; if the workload changes and the native code is not optimal, it will recompile the bytecode accordingly again.[...]

https://codepalousa.com/Sessions/1981[A Change-Data-Capture use-case: designing an evergreen cache^] @ https://codepalousa.com/[Code PaLOUsa^]::
+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

https://codepalousa.com/Sessions/2058[A Guided Tour of Caching Patterns^] @ https://codepalousa.com/[Code PaLOUsa^]::
+
You might have been using cache for years, and still always design the application to be responsible for the sync between the cache and the underlying data store. Did you know there are many more options available?

https://geekle.us/qa_volume2[Mutation Testing to the Rescue of your Tests^] @ null[QA Global Summit^]::
+
Code coverage is useless because of assertless testing. There‚Äôs a technique to replace it, it‚Äôs called Mutation Testing.

+
Go is ubiquitous in the Kubernetes ecosystem. But it‚Äôs not required at all to develop a K8s operator. Let‚Äôs try it with‚Ä¶ Java!
