Multiple ways to configure Spring (2021-09-26)::
Two weeks ago, I wrote how you could write a Spring application with no annotations. Many alternatives are available to configure your Spring app. I‚Äôd like to list them in this post, leaving Spring Boot out of the picture on purpose. Core concepts Property file XML Groovy DSL Self-annotated classes Configuration classes Kotlin DSL Bean definitions Beans Conclusion Core concepts A couple of concepts are central in Spring. The related documentation doesn‚Äôt describe most of them[...]

Beyond Hello World applications, zero-downtime deployments are not trivial. In this talk, I‚Äôll demo how to achieve that on a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and Hazelcast.

CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.
