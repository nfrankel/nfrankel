Implementing the Idempotency-Key specification on Apache APISIX (2024-04-07)::
Last week, I wrote an analysis of the IETF Idempotency-Key specification. The specification aims to avoid duplicated requests. In short, the idea is for the client to send a unique key along with the request:  If the server doesn&#8217;t know the key, it proceeds as usual and then stores the responseIf the server knows the key, it short-circuits any further processing and immediately returns the stored response  This post shows how to implement it with Apache APISIX.   Overview   Before starting [...]

Fixing duplicate API requests (2024-03-31)::
The first rule of distributed systems is 'Don&#8217;t distribute your system'. Designing distributed systems right is infamously hard for multiple reasons.   The idempotency concept   For example, a call to a function can succeed or fail in non-distributed systems. Once you move the called function to a remote component, a third option appears: you call the remote function but get no response from the component. At this point, it&#8217;s impossible to know whether the call reached the component o[...]

Apache APISIX North America Tour (2024-03-24)::
Once in a while, I write non-technical blog posts when I&#8217;ve something worth sharing. Today, I&#8217;d like to write about my North America 'Tour' across several conferences and user groups.   The first leg of my journey started in Oakland, California, with Developer Week. Developer Week is an established conference with different editions in several locations and online during the year. Though I&#8217;m on their advisory board, this is only the second time I&#8217;ve spoken at one of their [...]

https://devoxx.gr/talk/?id=5657[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devoxx.gr/[Devoxx Greece^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

https://www.lambdaconf.us/speakers/nicolas-frankel[Make Your Security Policy Auditable^] @ https://www.lambdaconf.us/[Lambda Conf^]::
+
Nowadays, I believe that everybody realizes the importance of preventing undue access to one's applications. Many conceptual models are available, RBAC, ABAC, you name it. Likewise, all popular stacks have frameworks and libraries to help developers implement your chose policy access. If your organization only has a handful of apps, that's all fine and dandy, but problems appear at scale. One such problem is to keep under control access configuration across dozens or even hundreds of apps. It requires regular, if not continuous auditing: it's impossible to achieve when the configuration is code, even worse if it's a compiled language. Open Policy Agent aims to externalize such configuration in a text format with a specified semantics. In this presentation, I'll explain OPA in more details and demo how to migrate from regular Spring Boot application to an OPA-based approach in different steps.
