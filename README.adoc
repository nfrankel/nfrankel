Vaadin, the battery-included server-side AJAX framework (2024-10-13)::
I&#8217;ve written a lot about Vaadin. I was so enthusiastic that I wrote the first book about it (besides the Book of Vaadin), its updated edition for Vaadin 7, and a companion website. Still, I&#8217;m amazed that so many people in the JVM world never heard of it.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to introduce Vaadin in the context of AJAX and SSR.   Short introduction to Vaadin   The beauty of Vaadin lies in its simplicity - you only write backend code. You read that well. A Vaadin developer only[...]

Augmenting the client with HTMX (2024-10-06)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client to augment the latter. So far, I described the process with Vue.js and Alpine.js. Both are similar from the developers' point of view: they involve JavaScript.   In this post, I&#8217;ll focus on HTMX, whose approach is quite different.   Laying out the work   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as in the previous posts of the series. Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-s[...]

Augmenting the client with Alpine.js (2024-09-29)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client, which is colloquially known as AJAX. I dedicated the previous post to Vue.js; I&#8217;ll dedicate this one to Alpine.js - not to be confused with Alpine Linux.   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as previously.   Laying out the work   Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-side  Here is how I integrate Thymeleaf and Alpine.js in the POM:   pom.xml  &lt;dependencies&gt;   [...]

https://www.thetesttribe.com/testflix-2024-nicolas-frankel/[An always up-to-date developer's CV^] @ https://www.thetesttribe.com/testflix/[Testflix^]::
+
It‚Äôs been said that GitHub is a developer‚Äôs CV. Just a quick look at your commit history and recruiters know all about you. There are a couple of issues with this approach. Most companies don‚Äôt even publish their source code under an Open Source license. If you work for one of them, and if you‚Äôre not a rabid Open Source developer, then it‚Äôs obviously not helpful. Recently, GitHub allowed some degree of customization of one‚Äôs profile. So, even if your commit history has more white than green, you can provide a good entry-point for potential employers. But it‚Äôs only as good as the effort you put in it, and it might decay fast. Yet, with a bit of work, and the help of automation tools (such as GitHub Actions), you can provide an always up-to-date profile. In this talk, I‚Äôll present you how to do it, using my own setup as an example.



https://bed-con.org/2024/programm[Evolving Your APIs, a Step-By-Step Approach^] @ http://www.bed-con.org/[Berlin Expert Days^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

+
As 'the Cloud' becomes more and more widespread, now is a good time to assess how you can containerize your Java application. I assume you‚Äôre able to write a a Dockerfile around the generated JAR. However, each time the application‚Äôs code will change, the whole image will need to be rebuilt. If you‚Äôre deploying to a local Kubernetes cluster environment, this increases that much the length of the feedback loop. In this demo-based talk, I‚Äôll present different ways to get your Java app in a container: Dockerfile, Jib, and Cloud Native Buildpacks. We will also have a look at what kind of Docker image they generate, how they layer the images, whether those images are compatible with skaffold, etc.
