A retrospective on Errors Management: where do we go from here? (2023-11-19)::
Error management is a fact of life in software development as it is often inevitable and generated by different causes that also include incorrect or incomplete understanding of the requirements or even lack of knowledge of some tools or elements used during development. Let‚Äôs go on a small trip into the evolutions and different concepts related to error management, analyzing why it is difficult and why we are going in new directions after the moment of Exceptions in programming languages[...]

Exploring the OpenTelemetry Collector (2023-11-12)::
The OpenTelemetry Collector sits at the center of the OpenTelemetry architecture but is unrelated to the W3C Trace Context. In my tracing demo, I use Jaeger instead of the Collector. Yet, it‚Äôs ubiquitous, as in every OpenTelemetry-related post. I wanted to explore it further. In this post, I explore the different aspects of the Collector: The data kind: logs, metrics, and tracesPush and pull modelsOperations: reads, transformations, and writes First steps A long time ago, observabilit[...]

API versioning (2023-11-05)::
In my previous post Evolving your APIs, I mention the main API versioning approaches. During the talk of the same name, I sometimes get some questions on the subject. In this post, I‚Äôll detail each of them. I assume readers know the reasons behind versioning, semantic versioning, and product lifecycle. If not, I encourage you to read a bit about these themes; in particular, chapter 24 of the excellent API Design Patterns book focuses on them. I‚Äôll summarize the subject in a few wo[...]

https://www.opensource-experience.com/event/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.opensource-experience.com/[Open Source Experience^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture. 


https://events.pinetool.ai/3079/#sessions/101285[Navigating Data Residency Challenges^] @ https://bigdataconference.lt/[Big Data Conference^]::
+
In today's interconnected world, organizations face a significant challenge: ensuring compliance with evolving data residency requirements while harnessing the transformative potential of globalized data. Data residency, the concept of where data is physically stored, has become a critical concern due to increasing regulatory demands and privacy concerns. As organizations expand their operations across borders, they encounter a myriad of legal and operational hurdles, necessitating a fresh perspective on managing data across jurisdictions. This talk aims to provide a couple of solutions to solve this problem, with pros and cons. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and the potential path forward to embrace globalized data securely.
