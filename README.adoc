Rust and the JVM (2021-07-18)::
This is the 7th post in the Start Rust focus series. So far, we have learned the basics of Rust syntax, developed a custom Kubernetes controller, and integrated with the front-end with Wasm. I‚Äôve been using the JVM for two decades now, mainly in Java. The JVM is an amazing piece of technology. IMHO, its biggest benefit is its ability to adapt the native code to the current workload; if the workload changes and the native code is not optimal, it will recompile the bytecode accordingly again.[...]

A Rust controller for Kubernetes (2021-07-11)::
This is the 6th post in the Start Rust focus series. To teach myself Kubernetes in general and controllers in particular, I previously developed one in Java. This week, I decide to do the same in Rust by following the same steps I did. The guiding principle is the creation of a Kubernetes controller that watches pods' lifecycle and 'binds' a sidecar to them. When the main pod is scheduled, the controller schedules the sidecar; when it‚Äôs deleted, it deletes it as well.[...]

Rust on the front-end (2021-07-04)::
This is the 5th post in the Start Rust focus series. Up until now, JavaScript has been the only ubiquitous language available in browsers. It has made JavaScript much more popular than its design (and its associated flaws) would have allowed. I don‚Äôt want to start a holy war about the merits of JavaScript, but IMHO, it only survived this far because of its role in browsers. In particular, the current architecture that moves the responsibility of executing the code from the server to the cli[...]

https://geekle.us/qa_volume2[Mutation Testing to the Rescue of your Tests^] @ null[QA Global Summit^]::
+
Code coverage is useless because of assertless testing. There‚Äôs a technique to replace it, it‚Äôs called Mutation Testing.

https://apachecon.com/acasia2021/sessions/1149.html[A Change-Data-Capture use-case: designing an evergreen cache^] @ https://apachecon.com/[ApacheCon Asia^]::
+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

+
While Reactive Programming is very different from the usual Imperative way, there‚Äôs no denying it fits ‚Äúthe Cloud‚Äù, as every bit of resource is used to its fullest. Let‚Äôs see how to migrate from the latter to the former using a Spring Boot web app as an example.
