High-cardinality values for build flags in Rust (2025-04-13)::
While working on my demo on WebAssembly and Kubernetes, I wanted to create three different binaries based on the same code:  Native: compile the Rust code to regular native code as a baselineEmbed: compile to WebAssembly and use the WasmEdge runtime image as the base Docker imageRuntime: compile to WebAssembly, use a base scratch image as my base image, and set the runtime when running the code  The code itself is an HTTP server that offers a single endpoint. For the sake of the demo, I wanted it[...]

Even more OpenTelemetry - Kubernetes special (2025-04-06)::
I have presented my OpenTelemetry demo many times, and I still do. Each time, the audience is different. To make no two presentations the same, I always ask attendees what stack they are more interested in. I also regularly add new features for the same reason.   I was a victim of the IT crisis last summer, and my company fired me, so I no longer work on Apache APISIX. They say that the Chinese ideogram for crisis contains the ideogram for opportunity. I used this opportunity to join LoftLabs. Lo[...]

Mutation Testing in Rust (2025-03-30)::
I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Mutation Testing since I discovered PIT. As I dive deeper into Rust, I wanted to check the state of mutation testing in Rust.   Starting with cargo-mutants   I found two crates for mutation testing in Rust:  cargo-mutantsand mutagen  mutagen hasn&#8217;t been maintained for three years, while cargo-mutants is still under active development.   I&#8217;ve ported the sample code from my previous Java code to Rust:    struct LowPassPredicate {     threshold: i32, }  impl [...]

https://jprime.io/speaker/409[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://jprime.io/[jPrime^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://2025.geecon.org/speakers/info.html?id=980[End-to-End Pull Request Testing on Kubernetes: A Walkthrough^] @ http://geecon.org/[GeeCon^]::
+
As applications increasingly rely on Kubernetes for deployment, ensuring seamless integration and end-to-end testing during pull requests is crucial. This talk dives into the practical steps of building a robust CI/CD pipeline that mirrors production environments, enabling reliable and efficient testing within your Kubernetes ecosystem. We‚Äôll explore how to: * Set up foundational unit and integration tests using modern tools like Testcontainers and GitHub Workflows. * Integrate Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to emulate a production-grade cluster for testing. * Leverage vCluster to isolate test environments, ensuring parallel runs and minimizing interference. * Attendees will gain actionable insights to create scalable and maintainable testing pipelines via an existing working example.
