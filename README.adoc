KCDC 2025 (2025-08-17)::
When I first started attending conferences, I diligently tried to write down notes and publish them. It forced me to actively listen to the talks I was attending. With the number of conferences rising, I couldn&#8217;t keep the rhythm. When I switched my career path to Developer Advocate, I drastically diminished the number of talks I attended in favor of the hallway track. As a result, the last conference 'report' I wrote was JPrime&#8217;s in 2022.   This week, I was privileged to speak at DevO[...]

OpenTelemetry configuration gotchas (2025-08-10)::
Last week, I described several approaches to OpenTelemetry on the JVM, their requirements, and their different results. This week, I want to highlight several gotchas found across stacks in the zero-code instrumentation.   The promise of OpenTelemetry   Since its inception, OpenTelemetry has unified the 3 pillars of observability. In the distributed tracing space, it replaced proprietary protocols Zipkin and Jaeger. IMHO, it achieved such success for several reasons:  First, a huge industry press[...]

OpenTelemetry Tracing on the JVM (2025-08-03)::
You may know I&#8217;m a big fan of OpenTelemetry. I recently finished developing a master class for the YOW! conference at the end of the year. During development, I noticed massive differences in configuration and results across programming languages. Even worse, differences exist across frameworks inside the same programming language.   In this post, I want to compare the different zero-code OpenTelemetry approaches on the JVM, covering the most widespread:  Spring Boot with Micrometer Tracing[...]

https://cloudxconf.com/speakers/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.developerweek.com/cloudx/[DeveloperWeek Cloud X^]::

Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
