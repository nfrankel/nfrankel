Writing for Developers (2025-05-25)::
I started this blog as a hobby seventeen years ago, in April 2008. At the time, I had no clue about technical writing. I&#8217;m pretty sure it was not even a thing back then: the only content aimed at developers was technical documentation. Since then, the landscape has changed a lot, to the point that companies hire for technical writer positions.   I was curious to compare what I learned by doing to the structured approach of a book. I ordered the book last year when it was still being written[...]

Getting a single value from a device's state in Home Assistant (2025-05-18)::
This is the 7th post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series. I recently acquired Netatmo smart radiator valves to manage my rooms' temperature remotely. I&#8217;m not skilled at manual tasks, but I could easily replace the old thermo-static valves. I then registered the smart ones in the Netatmo app. Finally, I integrated them in my Home Assistant via the dedicated Netatmo integration. Everything was very straightforward. I noticed that each valve not only allows remote control but al[...]

https://mobile.devoxx.com/events/voxxedlu2025/talks/1306/details[End-to-End Pull Request Testing on Kubernetes: A Walkthrough^] @ https://voxxeddays.com/luxembourg/[Voxxed Days Luxembourg^]::
+
As applications increasingly rely on Kubernetes for deployment, ensuring seamless integration and end-to-end testing during pull requests is crucial. This talk dives into the practical steps of building a robust CI/CD pipeline that mirrors production environments, enabling reliable and efficient testing within your Kubernetes ecosystem. We‚Äôll explore how to: * Set up foundational unit and integration tests using modern tools like Testcontainers and GitHub Workflows. * Integrate Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to emulate a production-grade cluster for testing. * Leverage vCluster to isolate test environments, ensuring parallel runs and minimizing interference. * Attendees will gain actionable insights to create scalable and maintainable testing pipelines via an existing working example.



https://www.kcdc.info/speakers[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.kcdc.info/[Kansas City Developer Conference^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://gotocph.com/2025/sessions/3729/webassembly-on-kubernetes[WebAssembly on Kubernetes^] @ https://gotocph.com/[GOTO Copenhagen^]::
+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
