Web resource caching: Server-side (2022-12-04)::
The subject of Web resource caching is as old as the World Wide Web itself. However, I‚Äôd like to offer an as-exhaustive-as-possible catalog of how one can improve performance by caching. Web resource caching can happen in two different places: client-side - on the browser and server side. In the previous post, I explained the former; this post focuses on the latter. While client-side caching works well, it has one central issue: to serve the resource locally, it must first have it in the [...]

Evolving your RESTful APIs, a step-by-step approach (2022-02-27)::
Designing an intuitive, user-friendly RESTful API is a tough job. It might already be a massive task if it‚Äôs your first attempt. Planning for the lifecycle management of your API is likely to be an afterthought. But it‚Äôs possible anyway: in this post, I‚Äôd like to propose a no-nonsense approach to evolving your APIs, even if it was not planned. The initial situation Let‚Äôs consider a sample application that says 'Hello' when using it. > curl http://org.apisix/hello Hello world > curl [...]

You shouldn't do microservices If you do, you're probably having tons of technical issues.In the good old days, applications were simple A browser send a request to a webapp endpoint; the latter fetched data from a database and returned the response. Mobile clients changed this approach.The display area of mobile clients is smaller:just smaller for tablets, much smaller for phones. A possible solution would be to return all data and let each client filter out the unnecessary one Unfortunately, phone clients also suffer from poorer bandwidth Hence, over-fetching is not an option Each client requires a different subset of the data. To avoid the over-fetching issue above, each microservice needs to serve the data strictly necessary for each kind of client It introduces coupling between a microservice to its clients. Backend For Front-end is an approach to tackle this issue In this talk, I'll describe it, its possible implementations and demo them.

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
