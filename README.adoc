A list of cache providers (2021-10-31)::
Last week, we described several criteria to look at to choose a cache. This week, it’s time to list Java cache providers based on these criteria. Java Caching System Guava Caffeine Ehcache Infinispan Coherence Community Edition Ignite Geode Hazelcast Java Caching System JCS is a distributed caching system written in Java. It is intended to speed up applications by providing a means to manage cached data of various dynamic natures. Like any caching system, JCS is most useful for h[...]

Choosing a cache (2021-10-24)::
Today, I’d like to provide some help on how to choose a cache solution. I will organize it into two parts: In this post, we will list what features a cache must have and which ones it can optionally provide. Most criteria are general and can be used regardless of the tech stack, while a couple is specific to the JVM.In the second part, I’ll list providers and verify their respective capabilities Why cache? First, let’s bust a common myth. Using a cache is not the sign of a b[...]

Kotlin and FaaS, an impossible union? (2021-10-17)::
Some time ago, I read a post describing how to run a serverless Kotlin function on OpenFaaS. While the content is technically correct, I believe the concept itself is very wrong. Such posts can lead people to make ill-advised decisions: 'because we can' is hardly a winning strategy. in this post, I’d like to first explain why the JVM platform is a bad idea for FaaS. Then, I’ll proceed to propose alternatives to use Kotlin nonetheless. I deliberately chose not to link to the original[...]

+
Beyond Hello World applications, zero-downtime deployments are not trivial. In this talk, I’ll demo how to achieve that on a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and Hazelcast.

+
Continuous deployment doesn’t necessarily mean Jenkins, or the latest hype tool. For JVM applications, one can directly deliver bytecode in production.

The Java API allows a lot: sending packets over the network, compiling code, etc. If you put an application in an production environment, you need to make sure it doesn’t do more than it’s supposed to do.
