Apache APISIX North America Tour (2024-03-24)::
Once in a while, I write non-technical blog posts when I&#8217;ve something worth sharing. Today, I&#8217;d like to write about my North America 'Tour' across several conferences and user groups.   The first leg of my journey started in Oakland, California, with Developer Week. Developer Week is an established conference with different editions in several locations and online during the year. Though I&#8217;m on their advisory board, this is only the second time I&#8217;ve spoken at one of their [...]

The pitfall of implicit returns (2024-03-17)::
Implicit returns are a feature in some languages. They have recently bitten me, so here&#8217;s my opinion.   Statements, expressions, and returns   Before diving into implicit returns, we must explain two programming concepts influencing them. A lot of literature is available on the subject, so I&#8217;ll paraphrase one of the existing definitions:     An expression usually refers to a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. In most programming languages, there are typically three differ[...]

Using my new Raspberry Pi to run an existing GitHub Action (2024-03-10)::
Recently, I mentioned how I refactored the script that kept my GitHub profile up-to-date. Since Geecon Prague, I&#8217;m also a happy owner of a Raspberry Pi:  Guess what I won @GeeCON Prague? üòé pic.twitter.com/b9dARUhfMd&mdash; Nicolas Frankel üá∫üá¶ (@nicolas_frankel) October 20, 2023     Though the current setup works flawlessly - and is free, I wanted to experiment with self-hosted runners.

https://indico.cern.ch/event/1366825/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://home.cern/[Centre Europ√©en de Recherche Nucl√©aire^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.



https://devoxx.gr/talk/?id=5657[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devoxx.gr/[Devoxx Greece^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
