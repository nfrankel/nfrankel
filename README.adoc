The Vary HTTP header (2024-05-05)::
I try to constantly deepen my knowledge of HTTP and REST. Recently, I stumbled upon the list of all registered HTTP Headers. This post is dedicated to the Vary HTTP Header.   The problem   Two years ago, I wrote about web resource caching server-side. The idea is to set up a component between the client and the upstream to cache previously computed results to avoid overloading the latter. Depending on your infrastructure and requirements, this component can be a reverse proxy or an API Gateway. H[...]

Five ways to pass parameters to Apache APISIX (2024-04-28)::
I recently read 6 Ways To Pass Parameters to Spring REST API. Though the title is a bit misleading, as it&#8217;s unrelated to REST, it does an excellent job listing all ways to send parameters to a Spring application. I want to do the same for Apache APISIX; it&#8217;s beneficial when you write a custom plugin.   General setup   The general setup uses Docker Compose and static configuration. I&#8217;ll have one plugin per way to pass parameters.   docker-compose.yml  services:   httpbin:     ima[...]

The try block in Rust (2024-04-21)::
I wrote previously about libs for error management in Rust. This week, I want to write about the try block, an experimental feature.   The limit of the ? operator   Please check the above article for a complete refresher on error management in general and the ? operator in particular. In short, ? allows to hook into a function call that returns a Result:  If the Result contains a value, it continues normallyIf it contains an error, it short-circuits and returns the Result to the calling function.[...]

https://jconeurope2024.sched.com/event/1YwRs[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ http://jcon.one/[JCON^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.

+
Lorsque vous publiez votre premi√®re API HTTP, vous avez tendance √† vous concentrer davantage sur les probl√©matiques √† court terme que sur l'avenir. Cependant, il y a des chances que votre application rencontre du succ√®s. La question se pose alors : comment faire √©voluer votre API sans rompre le contrat avec vos utilisateurs existants ? Dans cette pr√©sentation, je vous montrerai quelques trucs et astuces pour y parvenir : d√©placer vos points de terminaison, les d√©pr√©cier, surveiller qui les utilise et informer les utilisateurs des nouveaux points de terminaison. La pr√©sentation est bas√©e sur une d√©mo et j'utiliserai le projet Apache APISIX pour cela.
