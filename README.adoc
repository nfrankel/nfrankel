Digital Twins: A digital counterpart for a new concept of Product (2024-10-27)::
Digital Twins, are digital replicas of physical assets, processes, or systems used to simulate, monitor, and optimize their real-world counterparts. Through real-time data exchange and advanced analytics, digital twins provide a virtual environment for testing scenarios, predicting outcomes, and enhancing decision-making. This concept, first introduced by Michael Grieves in 2002, has rapidly evolved and now plays a crucial role in various sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities[...]

Summary of the AJAX frameworks comparison (2024-10-20)::
In previous weeks, I&#8217;ve analyzed several libraries and frameworks that augment the client with AJAX capabilities.  Vue.jsAlpine.jsHTMXVaadin  In this post, I&#8217;ll compare them across several axes.   Analysis    Frontend skills  Remember that I started this series from the point of view of a backend developer. In this section, I grade how much you need to know about client technologies to complete the job.  Team organization  In the introduction, I hinted that the decoupling of frontend [...]

Vaadin, the battery-included server-side AJAX framework (2024-10-13)::
I&#8217;ve written a lot about Vaadin. I was so enthusiastic that I wrote the first book about it (besides the Book of Vaadin), its updated edition for Vaadin 7, and a companion website. Still, I&#8217;m amazed that so many people in the JVM world never heard of it.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to introduce Vaadin in the context of AJAX and SSR.   Short introduction to Vaadin   The beauty of Vaadin lies in its simplicity - you only write backend code. You read that well. A Vaadin developer only[...]

+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
