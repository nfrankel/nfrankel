Faster Maven builds in Docker (2021-10-10)::
Last week, I described different techniques to fasten your Maven builds. Today, I‚Äôd like to widen the scope and do the same for Maven builds inside Docker. Between each run, we change the source code by adding a single blank line; between each section, we remove all built images, including the intermediate ones that are the results of the multi-stage build. The idea is to avoid reusing a previously built image. Baseline To compute a helpful baseline, we need a sample project. I create[...]

Faster Maven builds (2021-10-03)::
Builds require a few properties, chief among them reproducibility. I would consider speed to be low on the order of priorities. However, it‚Äôs also one of the most limiting factors to your release cycle: if your build takes T, you cannot release faster than each T. Hence, you‚Äôll probably want to speed up your builds after you‚Äôve reached a certain maturity level to enable more frequent releases. I want to detail some techniques you can leverage to make your Maven builds faster i[...]

Multiple ways to configure Spring (2021-09-26)::
Two weeks ago, I wrote how you could write a Spring application with no annotations. Many alternatives are available to configure your Spring app. I‚Äôd like to list them in this post, leaving Spring Boot out of the picture on purpose. Core concepts Property file XML Groovy DSL Self-annotated classes Configuration classes Kotlin DSL Bean definitions Beans Conclusion Core concepts A couple of concepts are central in Spring. The related documentation doesn‚Äôt describe most of them[...]

Beyond Hello World applications, zero-downtime deployments are not trivial. In this talk, I‚Äôll demo how to achieve that on a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and Hazelcast.

+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.
