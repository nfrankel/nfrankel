2023 in retrospective (2024-01-07)::
Last year, I wrote my first yearly retrospective. I liked the experience, so I&#8217;m trying one more time. Let the future decide if it will become a trend or not.   Before diving into our safe technological world, my thoughts go to Ukraine, to my friends who had to flee their own country, to other friends who fought on the front to defend it from an imperial power, and to all victims of an old kleptocrat who clings to power despite the cost to others. The free world needs to support Ukraine mor[...]

Five Apache projects you probably didn't know about (2023-12-17)::
In early 2021, I started to work on the Apache APISIX project. I have to admit that I had never heard about it before. In this post, I&#8217;d like to introduce some Apache projects that are less well-known than HTTPD or Kafka.   Apache APISIX    APISIX is an API Gateway. It builds upon OpenResty, a Lua layer built on top of the famous nginx reverse-proxy. APISIX adds abstractions to the mix, e.g., Route, Service, Upstream, and offers a plugin-based architecture.   Lots of plugins are provided ou[...]

Apache APISIX plugin priority, a leaky abstraction? (2023-12-10)::
Apache APISIX is an API Gateway, which builds upon the OpenResty reverse-proxy to offer a plugin-based architecture. The main benefit of such an architecture is that it brings structure to the configuration of routes. It&#8217;s a help at scale, when managing hundreds or thousands of routes.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to describe how plugins, priority, and phases play together and what pitfalls you must be aware of.   APISIX plugin&#8217;s priority   When you configure a route with multiple p[...]

## 🗣️ Upcoming talks



https://www.linkedin.com/posts/coffeejug_hey-friends-we-have-an-amazing-announcement-activity-7151219905084698624-JGC6/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.coffeejug.org/[Coffee JUG^]::

When you publish your first HTTP API, you’re more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you’ll be successful, and you’ll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I’ll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who’s using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I’ll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
