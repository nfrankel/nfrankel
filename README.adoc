OpenTelemetry Tracing on the JVM (2025-08-03)::
You may know I&#8217;m a big fan of OpenTelemetry. I recently finished developing a master class for the YOW! conference at the end of the year. During development, I noticed massive differences in configuration and results across programming languages. Even worse, differences exist across frameworks inside the same programming language.   In this post, I want to compare the different zero-code OpenTelemetry approaches on the JVM, covering the most widespread:  Spring Boot with Micrometer Tracing[...]

Git default options (2025-07-27)::
Git has become a fundamental part of our developers' daily routine that it&#8217;s hard to remember our lives without it. And yet, most of us use a limited set of commands and options. Today, I want to focus on two commands most developers probably use every day and look at the defaults behind them.   git push   After git commit, git push is probably the second most used command. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll teach you anything with this excerpt from the documentation:     git-push - Update remo[...]

Pattern-matching across different languages (2025-07-20)::
Pattern matching is a major feature in software development. While pattern matching applies in several locations, its current usage is limited to switch case blocks. I want to compare the power of pattern matching across a couple of programming languages I&#8217;m familiar with in this post.   I assume that every reader is familiar with the switch case syntax inherited from C. In short:  The switch clause references a value-returning statementEach case clause sets another statement; if the value [...]

https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-kansas-city/program/nicolas-fr%c3%a4nkel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.kcdc.info/[Kansas City Developer Conference^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
