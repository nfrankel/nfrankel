Why Home Assistant? (2024-11-24)::
This is the 1st post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series. Last June, I spoke at Berlin Buzzwords. In all honesty, I rarely attend others' talks for a variety of reasons: lack of time, lack of energy, no interest in the proposed subjects, etc. When I do, I go either for subjects I know and want to deepen my understanding of or for subjects I know nothing about to get a foot in the door. This time, I attended Monitoring your home, with DevOps observability tools. I thought it would b[...]

Pseudo-Random Number Generators: From the Origins to Modern Algorithms (2024-11-17)::
How can we generate a uniform sequence of random numbers? The randomness so beautifully and abundantly generated by nature has not always been easy for humans to extract and quantify.   Pseudo-Random Number Generators are fundamental tools in many areas of software development: PRNGs do not produce truly random numbers but rather deterministic sequences that simulate randomness. The quality of a PRNG is determined by its ability to produce sequences that are statistically indistinguishable from t[...]

Langchain4J musings (2024-11-10)::
I&#8217;m coming relatively late to the LLM party, but I rarely come very early in the hype cycle.        For example, I never bought into blockchain, the solution still searching for problems to solve, nor in microservices, the latest in the cargo cult IT trends. Despite my late arrival at the LLM party, I have been a regular user of LLMs. I use OpenAI for non-controversial questions outside my cone of knowledge, e.g., linguistics or legal; I use GitHub Copilot in my IDE to improve my code.   Th[...]

https://devfest.developers-group-dijon.fr/session/6ezt06lldhnfnynl7p80/[Introduction pratique √† OpenTelemetry pour les d√©veloppeurs^] @ https://devfest.developers-group-dijon.fr/[DevFest Dijon^]::
+
Il est essentiel de suivre le parcours d‚Äôune requ√™te √† travers les diff√©rents composants d‚Äôun syst√®me distribu√©. Avec l‚Äôessor des microservices, cette fonctionnalit√© a atteint un niveau de criticit√© comme jamais auparant. Certains outils propri√©taires de suivi vous sont peut-√™tre connus : Jaeger et Zipkin viennent naturellement √† l‚Äôesprit. L‚Äôobservabilit√© repose sur trois piliers : la journalisation, les m√©triques et le tra√ßage. OpenTelemetry est un effort conjoint visant √† mettre en place un standard ouvert pour ces trois piliers. Jaeger et Zipkin se sont joints √† cet effort et sont maintenant compatibles avec OpenTelemetry. Dans cet expos√©, je d√©crirai plus en d√©tail ce qui pr√©c√®de et je pr√©senterai un cas d‚Äôutilisation (simple) pour d√©montrer comment vous pourriez b√©n√©ficier des traces OpenTelemetry dans votre architecture distribu√©e.



https://www.meetup.com/amsterdam-java-user-group/events/304609015[Make Your Security Policy Auditable^] @ http://amsterdamjug.com/[Amsterdam JUG^]::
+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.



https://yavaconf.com/#agenda-section[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://yavaconf.com/[Ya!vaConf^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
