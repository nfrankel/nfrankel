Do You know how to batch? (2025-07-06)::
Concurrent systems face a delicate balance: enabling high throughput under contention while maintaining low latency and predictable behavior. Traditional locking strategies and naive parallelization often introduce performance bottlenecks through cache contention, false sharing, and excessive context switching. These issues are further exacerbated in Cloud and virtualized environments, where performance unpredictability, noisy neighbors, and limited control over physical resources introduce addit[...]

Broadcast devices' name on the local network (2025-06-29)::
With years, I accumulated devices on my local network, which in general run on Linux. I meticulously added them to my /etc/hosts/ file, so as not to remember their IP. Something puzzled me, though: my Synology NAS was readily available as nas.local on the network, without doing anything. I have close to zero skills in system administration, so here are my findings.   The .local domain   We can learn more about .local domain from Wikipedia.     The domain name .local is a special-use domain name r[...]

Testing an OpenRewrite recipe (2025-06-22)::
For the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve kicked the tires of OpenRewrite. At first, I created a recipe to move Kotlin source files as per the official recommendations with a set package name. I then improved the recipe to compute the root automatically. In both versions, I thoroughly tested the recipe. However, my testing approach was wrong. In this post, I want to describe my mistakes, and how I fixed them.   The naive approach   I originally approached the testing of the recipe in a very naive way, t[...]

https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-kansas-city/program/nicolas-fr%c3%a4nkel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.kcdc.info/[Kansas City Developer Conference^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
