A tentative comparison of fault tolerance libraries on the JVM (2022-01-09)::
If you‚Äôre implementing microservices or not, the chances are that you‚Äôre calling HTTP endpoints. With HTTP calls, a lot of things can go wrong. Experienced developers plan for this and design beyond just the happy path. In general, fault tolerance encompasses the following features: RetryTimeoutCircuit BreakerFallbackRate Limiter to avoid server-side 429 responsesBulkhead: Rate Limiter limits the number of calls in a determined timeframe, while Bulkhead limits the number of concurren[...]

Beautify third-party API with Kotlin (2021-12-19)::
Scala has popularized the 'Pimp my library' pattern: This is just a fancy expression to refer to the ability to supplement a library using implicit conversions. ‚Äî Pimp My Library Pattern in Scala Kotlin does provide the same capability. However, it achieves it via extension functions. While the generated bytecode is similar to Java‚Äôs static methods, the developer experience is the same as adding functions to existing types. This approach has limitations, though. One cannot[...]

CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

Beyond Hello World applications, zero-downtime deployments are not trivial. In this talk, I‚Äôll demo how to achieve that on a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and Hazelcast.

GitHub is a developer‚Äôs CV but what happens if you‚Äôre not working on any project hosted on GitHub. All hope is not lost: you can still customize your GitHub profile with all data you want.
