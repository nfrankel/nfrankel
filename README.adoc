Reassessing TestNG vs. Junit (2021-09-19)::
In my latest blog post, I advised reassessing one‚Äôs opinion now and then as the IT world changes fast. What was true a couple of years ago could be dead wrong nowadays, and you probably don‚Äôt want to base your decisions on outdated data. This week, I‚Äôd like to follow my advice. One of my first posts was advocating for TestNG vs. JUnit. In the post, I mentioned several features that JUnit lacked: No parameterizationNo groupingNo test method ordering Since JUnit 5 has been out[...]

Annotation-free Spring (2021-09-12)::
Some, if not most, of our judgments regarding technology stacks come either from third-party opinions or previous experiences. Yet, we seem to be adamant about them. For a long time (and sometimes even now), I‚Äôve seen posts that detailed how Spring is bad because it uses XML for its configuration. Unfortunately, they blissfully ignore the fact that annotation-based configuration has been available for ages. Probably because of the same reason I recently read that Spring is bad‚Ä¶‚Äã[...]

On metrics (2021-09-05)::
There‚Äôs still an ongoing debate whether development in particular and IT, in general, are engineering practices. In all cases, there‚Äôs no denying that our industry is based on scientific foundations. Most of the organizations I‚Äôve worked for implement the Deming wheel in one form or another: From a bird‚Äôs eye view, it makes a lot of sense. And given the success of the method in the Japanese car industry, there‚Äôs no denying that it‚Äôs effective. However,[...]

+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

https://sceniccitysummit.com/2021-schedule/[Zero-downtime deployment with Kubernetes^] @ https://sceniccitysummit.com/[Scenic City Summit^]::

Beyond Hello World applications, zero-downtime deployments are not trivial. In this talk, I‚Äôll demo how to achieve that on a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes and Hazelcast.

https://sceniccitysummit.com/2021-schedule/[A Guided Tour of Caching Patterns^] @ https://sceniccitysummit.com/[Scenic City Summit^]::
+
You might have been using cache for years, and still always design the application to be responsible for the sync between the cache and the underlying data store. Did you know there are many more options available?
