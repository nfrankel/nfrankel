Annotation-free Spring (2021-09-12)::
Some, if not most, of our judgments regarding technology stacks come either from third-party opinions or previous experiences. Yet, we seem to be adamant about them. For a long time (and sometimes even now), I‚Äôve seen posts that detailed how Spring is bad because it uses XML for its configuration. Unfortunately, they blissfully ignore the fact that annotation-based configuration has been available for ages. Probably because of the same reason I recently read that Spring is bad‚Ä¶‚Äã[...]

On metrics (2021-09-05)::
There‚Äôs still an ongoing debate whether development in particular and IT, in general, are engineering practices. In all cases, there‚Äôs no denying that our industry is based on scientific foundations. Most of the organizations I‚Äôve worked for implement the Deming wheel in one form or another: From a bird‚Äôs eye view, it makes a lot of sense.

+
While a plain Dockerfile gets the job done, there are actually many more ways to containerize your Java app. They come with a couple of pros, and some cons.

https://apachecon.com/acah2021/tracks/bigdata.html#W1540[A Change-Data-Capture use-case: designing an evergreen cache^] @ https://apachecon.com/[ApacheCon^]::
+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2021/proposals/a-walk-through-caching-patterns~dyP8E/[A walk through Caching Patterns^] @ https://in.pycon.org/[PyCon India^]::

You might have been using cache for years, and still always design the application to be responsible for the sync between the cache and the underlying data store. Did you know there are many more options available?
