Python "magic" methods - part 2 (2023-10-22)::
Let‚Äôs continue our exploration of Python‚Äôs magic methods in this second part of the series. This part will focus on numbers and containers, i.e., collections. You can read the first part here. Container-related methods Python provides the usual containers, e.g., lists, sets, and dictionaries. You can use the following methods when you want to implement your own. Common methods Containers have a size. Python defines two methods to implement to return the number of items in a con[...]

Python "magic" methods (2023-10-15)::
Python provides specially-named methods: methods that the runtime interprets in a certain way, but that you need to know about. The documentation is pretty exhaustive about them, but it needs examples for beginners. The goal of this two-part series is to list these methods and provide these examples, so that I can remember them. Part 1Part 2[...]

Python "magic" methods - part 1 (2023-10-15)::
Java was the first language I used professionally and is the scale by which I measure other languages I learned afterward. It‚Äôs an OOP statically-typed language. Hence, Python feels a bit weird because of its dynamic typing approach. For example, Object offers methods equals(), hashCode(), and toString(). Because all other classes inherit from Object, directly or indirectly, all objects have these methods by definition. Conversely, Python was not initially built on OOP principles and is[...]

https://heapcon.io/2023/evolving-your-apis-a-step-by-step-approach-by-nicolas-frankel/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ heapcon.io[Heapcon^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.


https://softcon.ph/speaker/nicolas-frankel/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://softcon.ph/[Softcon^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
