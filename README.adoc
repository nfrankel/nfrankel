Choosing a cache (2021-10-24)::
Today, I‚Äôd like to provide some help on how to choose a cache solution. I will organize it into two parts: In this post, we will list what features a cache must have and which ones it can optionally provide. Most criteria are general and can be used regardless of the tech stack, while a couple is specific to the JVM.In the second part, I‚Äôll list providers and verify their respective capabilities Why cache? First, let‚Äôs bust a common myth. Using a cache is not the sign of a b[...]

Kotlin and FaaS, an impossible union? (2021-10-17)::
Some time ago, I read a post describing how to run a serverless Kotlin function on OpenFaaS. While the content is technically correct, I believe the concept itself is very wrong. Such posts can lead people to make ill-advised decisions: 'because we can' is hardly a winning strategy. in this post, I‚Äôd like to first explain why the JVM platform is a bad idea for FaaS. Then, I‚Äôll proceed to propose alternatives to use Kotlin nonetheless. I deliberately chose not to link to the original[...]

Faster Maven builds in Docker (2021-10-10)::
Last week, I described different techniques to fasten your Maven builds. Today, I‚Äôd like to widen the scope and do the same for Maven builds inside Docker. Between each run, we change the source code by adding a single blank line; between each section, we remove all built images, including the intermediate ones that are the results of the multi-stage build. The idea is to avoid reusing a previously built image. Baseline To compute a helpful baseline, we need a sample project. I create[...]

The Java API allows a lot: sending packets over the network, compiling code, etc. If you put an application in an production environment, you need to make sure it doesn‚Äôt do more than it‚Äôs supposed to do.

Keeping your derived data (cache, search index, etc.) in synch with your source of truth is a challenge. In this, we will provide you with a straightfoward way to achieve it with the help of Change-Data-Capture.

While a plain Dockerfile gets the job done, there are actually many more ways to containerize your Java app. They come with a couple of pros, and some cons.
