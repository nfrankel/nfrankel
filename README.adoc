Alternatives to DTO (2022-03-05)::
More than a decade ago, I wrote about the DTO: A data transfer object is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces, where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that woul[...]

Evolving your RESTful APIs, a step-by-step approach (2022-02-27)::
Designing an intuitive, user-friendly RESTful API is a tough job. It might already be a massive task if it‚Äôs your first attempt. Planning for the lifecycle management of your API is likely to be an afterthought. But it‚Äôs possible anyway: in this post, I‚Äôd like to propose a no-nonsense approach to evolving your APIs, even if it was not planned. The initial situation Let‚Äôs consider a sample application that says 'Hello' when using it. > curl http://org.apisix/hello Hello world > curl [...]

Avoiding Stringly-typed in Kotlin (2022-02-20)::
A couple of years ago, I developed an application in Kotlin based on Camunda BPMN to help me manage my conference submission workflow. It tracks my submissions in Trello and synchronizes them on Google Calendar and in a Google Sheet. Google Calendar offers a REST API. As REST APIs go, it‚Äôs cluttered with String everywhere. Here‚Äôs an excerpt of the code: fun execute(color: String, availability: String) { findCalendarEntry(client, google, execution.conference)?.let { it.c[...]

En tant que d√©veloppeurs nous travaillons de plus en plus dans un monde interconnect√©. Peut-√™tre √™tes vous en train de d√©velopper des microservices ? Peut-√™tre exposez vous vos APIs sur le web ? Dans tous les cas, ces APIs web sont la colle qui maintient votre architecture en place. Dans le monde java, nous avons la chance d‚Äôavoir √† disposition de nombreuses librairies pour nous aider √† traiter tous les probl√®mes connexes: limitation de d√©bit, authentification, d√©couverte de services et bien d‚Äôautres. Cependant, ces probl√®mes sont transverses. Ils impactent toutes nos applications de la m√™me mani√®re. Aussi peut-√™tre que les librairies ne sont pas la solution optimale √† ces probl√®mes. Les API Gateways sont populaires et tr√®s utilis√©es de nos jours pour transf√®rer cesz probl√®mes des applications vers un point central. Dans cette pr√©sentation, je d√©crirai en d√©tail certains de ces probl√®mes et comment tirer profit d‚Äôune API Gateway. Puis je listerai les diff√©rentes solutions disponibles sur le march√©. Enfin je terminerai par une d√©mo d‚ÄôAPISIX, un projet de la fondation Apache, construit au dessus de NGINX et qui offre de nombreuses fonctionnalit√©s qui peuvent aider vos d√©veloppements.

As developers, we live more and more in an interconnected world. Perhaps you‚Äôre developing microservices? Maybe you‚Äôre exposing your APIs on the web? In all cases, web APIs are the glue that binds our architecture together. In the Java world, we are very fortunate to have a lot of libraries to help us manage related concerns: rate limiting, authentication, service discovery; you name it. Yet, these concerns are cross-cutting. They impact all our applications in the same way. Perhaps libraries are not the optimal way to handle them. API Gateways are a popular and nowadays quite widespread way to move these concerns out of the applications to a central place. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe in more detail some of these concerns and how you can benefit from an API Gateway. Then, I‚Äôll list some of the available solutions on the market. Finally, I‚Äôll demo APISIX, an Apache-managed project built on top of NGINX that offers quite a few features to help you ease your development.

In the industry, it's always an interesting experience to notice the drop in productivity of developers working on the same application across years. Depending on which stage a feature is implemented, it can take double (or triple?) the time. As software rots, there comes a time when it's less expensive to rewrite the application from scratch. Organizations don't want to face this issue: maintenance of existing software is a hot topic among developers of all tech stacks. In this talk, I'll walk through some maintenance-related issues that I've faced in two decades working in different technical roles across various organizations and a couple of industries. I'll tell tales of sweat, tears, and blood. Don't expect a happy end!
