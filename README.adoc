Renovate for everything (2024-06-23)::
In my earlier post about moving from Kotlin Scripting to Python, I mentioned several reasons:  Separating the content from the scriptKotlin Scripting is an unloved child of JetBrainsRenovate cannot update Kotlin Scripting files  I was wrong on the third point. Here&#8217;s my mea culpa.   First things first, Renovate does indeed manages Kotlin Scripting files - since 2022.   Even better, Renovate can manage any type of file. Thanks to Max Andersen for the tip:  JVM&#39;s are cheap; not having to [...]

A refresher on GitHub Pages (2024-06-16)::
I moved my blog from WordPress to GitLab Pages in&#8230;&#8203; 2016. I&#8217;m happy with the solution. However, I used GitHub Pages when I was teaching for both the courses and the exercises, e.g., Java EE. At the time, there was no GitHub Actions: I used Travis CI to build and deploy.   Recently, I had to use GitHub Pages to publish my Apache APISIX workshop. Travis is no longer free. GitHub Actions are a thing. I used the now nominal path and faced a few hurdles; here are my findings.   GitHu[...]

Random and fixed routes with Apache APISIX (2024-06-09)::
My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at Apache APISIX. Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:     We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I&#8217;ll give an example for better understanding.   We have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html a[...]

https://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/vortraege/evolving-your-apis/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/[Java Forum Stuttgart^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.



https://devopsstage.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel-2/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devopsstage.com/[DevOps Stage^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://softcon.ph/speaker/nicolas-frankel/[Chopping the monolith^] @ https://softcon.ph/[Softcon^]::
+
Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.
