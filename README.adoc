A refresher on GitHub Pages (2024-06-16)::
I moved my blog from WordPress to GitLab Pages in&#8230;&#8203; 2016. I&#8217;m happy with the solution. However, I used GitHub Pages when I was teaching for both the courses and the exercises, e.g., Java EE. At the time, there was no GitHub Actions: I used Travis CI to build and deploy.   Recently, I had to use GitHub Pages to publish my Apache APISIX workshop. Travis is no longer free. GitHub Actions are a thing. I used the now nominal path and faced a few hurdles; here are my findings.   GitHu[...]

Random and fixed routes with Apache APISIX (2024-06-09)::
My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at Apache APISIX. Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:     We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I&#8217;ll give an example for better understanding.   We have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html a[...]

Even more Opentelemetry! (2024-06-02)::
I continue to work on my Opentelemetry demo. Its main idea is to showcase traces across various technology stacks, including asynchronous communication via an MQTT queue. This week, I added a couple of components and changed the architecture. Here are some noteworthy learnings; note that some of them might not be entirely connected to OpenTelemetry.   Here&#8217;s an updated diagram. New components appear in violet, and updated components appear in green.        I want to be able to add more comp[...]

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.

Die Entwicklung einer vollwertigen API braucht Ressourcen, sowohl Zeit als auch Geld. Ihr m√ºsst √ºber das Modell, das Design, die REST-Grunds√§tze usw. nachdenken, ohne eine einzige Zeile Code zu schreiben. Meistens wei√ü man nicht, ob es sich lohnt: Man m√∂chte ein Minimum Viable Product anbieten und von dort aus iterieren. In diesem Vortrag m√∂chte ich euch zeigen, wie ihr das mit PostgreSQL, PostgREST und Apache APISIX erreichen k√∂nnt.

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
