diceroller, a sample Rust project (2021-07-25)::
This is the 8th post in the Start Rust focus series. For me, the best learning process is switching regularly between learning and doing, theory and practice. The last post was research, hence, this one will be coding. I‚Äôve been a player of Role-Playing Games since I‚Äôm 11. Of course, I‚Äôve played Dungeons & Dragons (mainly the so-called Advanced Edition) but after a few years, I‚Äôve taken upon Champions and its HERO system. The system is based on points allotment and all[...]

Rust and the JVM (2021-07-18)::
This is the 7th post in the Start Rust focus series. So far, we have learned the basics of Rust syntax, developed a custom Kubernetes controller, and integrated with the front-end with Wasm. I‚Äôve been using the JVM for two decades now, mainly in Java. The JVM is an amazing piece of technology. IMHO, its biggest benefit is its ability to adapt the native code to the current workload; if the workload changes and the native code is not optimal, it will recompile the bytecode accordingly again.[...]

A Rust controller for Kubernetes (2021-07-11)::
This is the 6th post in the Start Rust focus series. To teach myself Kubernetes in general and controllers in particular, I previously developed one in Java. This week, I decide to do the same in Rust by following the same steps I did. The guiding principle is the creation of a Kubernetes controller that watches pods' lifecycle and 'binds' a sidecar to them. When the main pod is scheduled, the controller schedules the sidecar; when it‚Äôs deleted, it deletes it as well.[...]

https://codepalousa.com/Sessions/1981[A Change-Data-Capture use-case: designing an evergreen cache^] @ https://codepalousa.com/[Code PaLOUsa^]::
+
CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

https://codepalousa.com/Sessions/2058[A Guided Tour of Caching Patterns^] @ https://codepalousa.com/[Code PaLOUsa^]::
+
You might have been using cache for years, and still always design the application to be responsible for the sync between the cache and the underlying data store. Did you know there are many more options available?

https://geekle.us/qa_volume2[Mutation Testing to the Rescue of your Tests^] @ null[QA Global Summit^]::
+
Code coverage is useless because of assertless testing. There‚Äôs a technique to replace it, it‚Äôs called Mutation Testing.
