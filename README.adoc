On dependencies in objects (2025-10-12)::
In OOP, objects collaborate. The initial idea of collaboration, first found in Smalltalk, was for object A to send a message to object B. Languages designed later use method calling. In both cases, the same question stands: how does an object reference other objects to reach the desired results?   In this post, I tackle the problem of passing dependencies to an object. I will go through several options and analyze their respective pros and cons.   Constructor injection   For constructor injection[...]

Transactions and ThreadLocal in Spring (2025-10-05)::
Two years ago, my friend Jos√© Paumard held the talk 'Concurrent and Asynchronous Programming : Loom' at the Geneva Java User Group. In his talk, he mentioned that the Spring team would need to completely redesign their approach to transaction: his reasoning was that the transactions are implemented on top of ThreadLocal object and Loom&#8217;s virtual threads break this approach. I was intrigued because though I used Spring transactions a lot via the @Transactional annotation, I never opened thou[...]

Privacy for subdomains: the solution (2025-09-28)::
Last week, I described a gloomy situation: all public TLS certificate providers log your requests. By browsing through the subdomains, one can get their respective IP addresses. If one of them points to your home route, they know your general location.   I analyzed several solutions and decided to use wildcard certificates, which don&#8217;t leak subdomain information, while continuing to use Let&#8217;s Encrypt. My solution caters to my Synology NAS, as it&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m using.   Gett[...]

WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
