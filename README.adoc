Resizing images on-the-fly (2023-10-01)::
As a web architect, one of the many issues is asset management. And the most significant issue in assets is images. A naive approach would be to set an image and let the browser resize the image via CSS: img { height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; } However, it means that you download the original image. It entails two problems: the size of the original image and the suboptimal browser-based resizing. This post will cover two alternatives: traditional and brand-new s[...]

Down the rabbit hole of an Apache APISIX plugin (2023-09-24)::
My demo, Evolving your APIs, features a custom Apache APISIX plugin. I believe that the process of creating a custom plugin is relatively well-documented. However, I wanted to check the parameters of the _M.access(conf, ctx) function, especially the ctx one. The documentation states: The ctx parameter caches data information related to the request. You can use core.log.warn(core.json.encode(ctx, true)) to output it to error.log for viewing. Unfortunately, core.log ultimately depends on [...]

Monkey-patching in Java (2023-09-17)::
The JVM is an excellent platform for monkey-patching. Monkey patching is a technique used to dynamically update the behavior of a piece of code at run-time. A monkey patch (also spelled monkey-patch, MonkeyPatch) is a way to extend or modify the runtime code of dynamic languages (e.g. Smalltalk, JavaScript, Objective-C, Ruby, Perl, Python, Groovy, etc.) without altering the original source code. ‚Äî Wikipedia I want to demo several approaches for monkey-patching in Java in this post[...]

## üó£Ô∏è Upcoming talks


https://devfest.at/schedule/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://devfest.at/[DevFest Vienna^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

https://devopsstage.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel-2/[Back to basics, getting traffic into your Kubernetes cluster^] @ https://devopsstage.com/[DevOps Stage^]::

However you're using your Kubernetes cluster, you'll sooner or later need to direct traffic into it. At this point, you're spoiled with choice. Kubernetes provides no less than three different objects: NodePort, Ingress, and LoadBalancer. Of course, each of them comes with its limitations. For example, LoadBalancer requires a dedicated implementation provided by Cloud Platforms but not with most local distributions. Moreover, Kubernetes is introducing a new Gateway API, adding one more way to direct traffic to the cluster. In this talk, I'd like to offer an overview of all four options, with their pros and cons, and a more in-depth explanation of the new Gateway API.
