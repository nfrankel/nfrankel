XML Schema Validation 1.1 in Java (2025-11-09)::
This week, I received an interesting task: dusting off a legacy Java application. The application analyzes specific XML files in proprietary format. I know XML doesn&#8217;t sound sexy to junior developers, but it has an amazing benefit. One can validate a file against a grammar. Such grammar is called an XSD, the acronym for XML Schema Definition. Fun fact: you write XSDs in XML.   In this post, I explain the problem, what I tried, and the final working solution.   The problem   The good thing i[...]

Choosing a dependency (2025-11-02)::
Fun fact, I thought I had already written this post, but when I wanted to reference it, I found out that I didn&#8217;t. In this post, I&#8217;d like to describe my approach when choosing a dependency. I&#8217;ll first define what I mean by dependency in the context of this post. Then, I&#8217;ll list a grid of several criteria to analyze possible dependencies with.   What is a dependency?   A dependency is literally something your software depends on: infrastructure such as a filesystem or a dat[...]

AsciiDoc over Markdown (2025-10-26)::
I taught myself HTML a long time ago, on a software called HotDog (Pro?). There wasn&#8217;t such a thing as WYSIWYG capabilities at the time. However, HotDog had an amazing feature: the toolbar had all HTML tags (there weren&#8217;t that many at the time) as buttons, and you could learn them by clicking on them and watching the results. The only downside was that you had to click on another button to close the tag.   Then came Dreamweaver. It was the first WYSIWYG editor, and it immediately beca[...]

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
