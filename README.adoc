Since Docker announced that it would remove unused images from Docker Hub, I‚Äôve been interested in listing places where I could host mine. As it‚Äôs for personal purposes, I‚Äôm interested in free plans. Here‚Äôs what I found.[...]

Updating data files, commits vs. pull requests (2021-08-15)::
For once, I‚Äôm wondering a bit if this post can be helpful to somebody else. I believe my context is pretty specific. Anyway, just in case it might be the case, here it is. My Jet Train project makes use of GTFS. GTFS stands for General Transit Feed Specification. It models public transportation schedules and their associated geographic information.
