On inheritance and subtyping (2025-01-26)::
Java is the first language I learned in my career. Its structure is foundational in my early years of understanding programming concepts. After going through several other languages with very different approaches, I&#8217;ve widened my point of view. Today, I want to reflect on the idea of inheritance.   Inheritance in Java   In Java, the idea of inheritance is tightly coupled with the concept of subtyping. Subtyping is the implementation of a IS A relationship. For example, the Rabbit class is a[...]

My first steps with Playwright (2025-01-19)::
In my previous company, I developed a batch job that tracked metrics across social media, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, Reddit, etc. Then I realized I could duplicate it for my own 'persona'. The problem is that some media don&#8217;t provide an HTTP API for the metrics I want. Here are the metrics I want on LinkedIn:      I searched for a long time but found no API access for the metrics above. I scraped the metrics manually every morning for a long time and finally decided to au[...]

The Home Assistant companion app (2025-01-12)::
Besides a regular webapp and a Mac app, which uses the same endpoints as the webapp, Home Assistant also provides mobile apps. In this post, I want to describe its advantages over the former. I&#8217;ll use iOS to do this: Samsung&#8217;s French partner to recycle used mobiles tricked me once, and I moved away from Samsung. I decided to buy Apple for better integration since I&#8217;ve had Mac computers for the last few years.   Installing and configuring   The companion app is readily available [...]

https://www.meetup.com/belgian-java-user-group/events/305632961/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://bejug.github.io/[Belgian Java User Group^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

https://2025.europe.jcon.one/schedule[WebAssembly on Kubernetes^] @ http://jcon.one/[JCON^]::
+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
