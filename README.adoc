Calling Rust from Python (2023-10-08)::
I recently watched GOTO conferences' talk Calling Functions Across Languages by Richard Feldman. I‚Äôm afraid I have to disagree with using the term 'language' in this context. It‚Äôs a no-brainer to call Java from Kotlin or Scala or to call Java from Kotlin. Hence, in the rest, I‚Äôll use 'stack'. In the talk, the speaker cites two main reasons to go on this road: Gradual migration from one stack to the otherUsing a library that has no equivalent in one‚Äôs stack under the ass[...]

Resizing images on-the-fly (2023-10-01)::
As a web architect, one of the many issues is asset management. And the most significant issue in assets is images. A naive approach would be to set an image and let the browser resize the image via CSS: img { height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain; } However, it means that you download the original image. It entails two problems: the size of the original image and the suboptimal browser-based resizing. This post will cover two alternatives: traditional and brand-new s[...]

Down the rabbit hole of an Apache APISIX plugin (2023-09-24)::
My demo, Evolving your APIs, features a custom Apache APISIX plugin. I believe that the process of creating a custom plugin is relatively well-documented. However, I wanted to check the parameters of the _M.access(conf, ctx) function, especially the ctx one. The documentation states: The ctx parameter caches data information related to the request. You can use core.log.warn(core.json.encode(ctx, true)) to output it to error.log for viewing. Unfortunately, core.log ultimately depends on [...]

https://2023.geecon.cz/speakers/[Data Residency: the fun of storing data worldwide^] @ https://2018.geecon.cz/[GeeCon Prague^]::
+
In today's interconnected world, organizations face a significant challenge: ensuring compliance with evolving data residency requirements while harnessing the transformative potential of globalized data. Data residency, the concept of where data is physically stored, has become a critical concern due to increasing regulatory demands and privacy concerns. As organizations expand their operations across borders, they encounter a myriad of legal and operational hurdles, necessitating a fresh perspective on managing data across jurisdictions. This talk aims to provide a couple of solutions to solve this problem, with pros and cons. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and the potential path forward to embrace globalized data securely. 


https://nordicapis.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel/[Evolving Your APIs, a Step-By-Step Approach^] @ https://nordicapis.com/events/[Platform Summit^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
