Replace Philips Hue automation with Home Assistant's (2024-12-08)::
This is the 3rd post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series. I&#8217;m the happy owner of a couple of Philips Hue connected lights for a some years. Some of them are colored, some of them regular. In addition, I bought a sensor to go along with the light I installed in my toilets: it turns on automatically when its detects a movement there. In this post, I want to document how I replaced the proprietary automation with Home Assistant&#8217;s.[...]

The Home Assistant model (2024-12-01)::
Home Assistant is a massive beast. It can be overwhelming for a newcomer; it was for me. In this post, I want to describe the underlying model of Home Assistant, which is a good entry point for your home automation journey.   The biggest issue in describing the Home Assistant is the number of conflicting sources for this model:  The helpers package of the GitHub repositoryThe database; disclaimer: I didn&#8217;t find the schema generation in the code, and I wasn&#8217;t bold enough to check the d[...]

Why Home Assistant? (2024-11-24)::
This is the 1st post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series. Last June, I spoke at Berlin Buzzwords. In all honesty, I rarely attend others' talks for a variety of reasons: lack of time, lack of energy, no interest in the proposed subjects, etc. When I do, I go either for subjects I know and want to deepen my understanding of or for subjects I know nothing about to get a foot in the door.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
