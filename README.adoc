System architecture: move authentication to the API Gateway (2023-07-30)::
When exposing an application to the outside world, consider a Reverse-Proxy or an API Gateway to protect it from attacks. Rate Limiting comes to mind first, but it shouldn’t stop there. We can factor many features in the API Gateway and should be bold in moving them from our apps. In this post, I’ll show how to implement authentication at the Gateway API stage. Overall authentication flow The API Gateway doesn’t authenticate but delegates authentication to an authentication [...]

Apache APISIX without etcd (2023-07-23)::
etcd is an excellent key-value distributed database used internally by Kubernetes and managed by the CNCF. It’s a great option, and that’s the reason why Apache APISIX uses it too. Yet, it’s not devoid of issues. First, some mention scalability, but one can expect this from a distributed data store that values consistency. Another issue may be the need for more familiarity with etcd. It’s relatively new, so your Ops team may need help operating it correctly while having [...]

https://www.meetup.com/seajug/events/294009209[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.seajug.org/[Seattle Java User Group^]::
+
Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture. 


https://www.meetup.com/seattle-kubernetes-meetup/events/294800920/[Back to basics, getting traffic into your Kubernetes cluster^] @ https://www.meetup.com/seattle-kubernetes-meetup/[Seattle Metro Kubernetes Meetup^]::
+
However you're using your Kubernetes cluster, you'll sooner or later need to direct traffic into it. At this point, you're spoiled with choice. Kubernetes provides no less than three different objects: NodePort, Ingress, and LoadBalancer. Of course, each of them comes with its limitations. For example, LoadBalancer requires a dedicated implementation provided by Cloud Platforms but not with most local distributions. Moreover, Kubernetes is introducing a new Gateway API, adding one more way to direct traffic to the cluster. In this talk, I'd like to offer an overview of all four options, with their pros and cons, and a more in-depth explanation of the new Gateway API.

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it’s an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it’s plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there’s a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I’ll detail every point I’ve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.
