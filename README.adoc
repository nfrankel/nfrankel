Advanced URL rewriting with Apache APISIX (2024-07-14)::
I spoke at Swiss PgDay in Switzerland in late June. The talk was about how to create a no-code API with the famous PostgreSQL database, the related PostgREST, and Apache APISIX, of course. I already wrote about the idea in a previous post. However, I wanted to improve it, if only slightly.   PostgREST offers a powerful SELECT mechanism. To list all entities with a column equal to a value, you need the following command:    curl /products?id=eq.1   id is the columneq.1 corresponds to the WHERE cla[...]

Dynamic watermarking with imgproxy and Apache APISIX (2024-07-07)::
Last week, I described how to add a dynamic watermark to your images on the JVM. I didn&#8217;t find any library, so I had to develop the feature, or, more precisely, an embryo of a feature, by myself. Depending on your tech stack, you must search for an existing library or roll up your sleeves. For example, Rust offers such an out-of-the-box library. Worse, this approach might be impossible to implement if you don&#8217;t have access to the source image.   Another alternative is to use ready-mad[...]

Dynamic watermarking on the JVM (2024-06-30)::
Displaying images on your website makes for an interesting problem: on one side, you want to make them publicly available; on the other, you want to protect them against undue use. The age-long method to achieve it is watermarking:     A digital watermark is a kind of marker covertly embedded in a noise-tolerant signal such as audio, video or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such signal. 'Watermarking' is the process of hiding digital information in a car[...]

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
