Error management in Rust, and libs that support it (2024-02-11)::
As part of learning the Rust ecosystem, I dedicated the last few days to error management. Here are my findings.   Error management 101   The Rust book describes the basics of error management. The language separates between recoverable errors and unrecoverable ones.   Unrecoverable errors benefit from the panic!() macro. When Rust panics, it stops the program. Recoverable errors are much more enjoyable.   Rust uses the Either monad, which stems from Functional Programming. Opposite to exceptions[...]

https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/software-crafters-montreal/events/298710071/[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/software-crafters-montreal/[Software Crafters Montr√©al^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.



https://www.meetup.com/ottawa-java-user-group/events/299043919[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.meetup.com/ottawa-java-user-group[Ottawa Java User Group^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
