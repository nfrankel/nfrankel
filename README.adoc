Feedback from calling Rust from Python (2023-10-29)::
I got plenty of feedback on my post about Calling Rust from Python: Hacker News/r/python/r/rust Many comments mentioned pyo3, and I should use it instead of cooking my own. Thanks to the authors, I checked: in this post, I explain what it is and how I migrated my code. What is pyo3? Rust bindings for Python, including tools for creating native Python extension modules. Running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary is also supported. ‚Äî PyO3 user guide Indeed, pyo3[...]

Python "magic" methods - part 2 (2023-10-22)::
Let‚Äôs continue our exploration of Python‚Äôs magic methods in this second part of the series. This part will focus on numbers and containers, i.e., collections. You can read the first part here. Container-related methods Python provides the usual containers, e.g., lists, sets, and dictionaries. You can use the following methods when you want to implement your own. Common methods Containers have a size. Python defines two methods to implement to return the number of items in a con[...]

Python "magic" methods (2023-10-15)::
Python provides specially-named methods: methods that the runtime interprets in a certain way, but that you need to know about. The documentation is pretty exhaustive about them, but it needs examples for beginners. The goal of this two-part series is to list these methods and provide these examples, so that I can remember them. Part 1Part 2[...]

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.

It‚Äôs been said that GitHub is a developer‚Äôs CV. Just a quick look at your commit history and recruiters know all about you. There are a couple of issues with this approach. Most companies don‚Äôt even publish their source code under an Open Source license. If you work for one of them, and if you‚Äôre not a rabid Open Source developer, then it‚Äôs obviously not helpful. Recently, GitHub allowed some degree of customization of one‚Äôs profile. So, even if your commit history has more white than green, you can provide a good entry-point for potential employers. But it‚Äôs only as good as the effort you put in it, and it might decay fast. Yet, with a bit of work, and the help of automation tools (such as GitHub Actions), you can provide an always up-to-date profile. In this talk, I‚Äôll present you how to do it, using my own setup as an example.
