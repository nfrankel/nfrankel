My second Cloudflare Tunnel (2025-11-30)::
I decided to stop using Twitter, but for my own content and supporting Ukraine against its barbarian invaders, I understood the contemporary media landscape was quite fragmented. I bet on Mastodon, Bluesky, and LinkedIn. My flow is the following: when I read a piece I find interesting, I schedule it for publication.

WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
