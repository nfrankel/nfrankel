Vaadin, the battery-included server-side AJAX framework (2024-10-13)::
I&#8217;ve written a lot about Vaadin. I was so enthusiastic that I wrote the first book about it (besides the Book of Vaadin), its updated edition for Vaadin 7, and a companion website. Still, I&#8217;m amazed that so many people in the JVM world never heard of it.   In this post, I&#8217;d like to introduce Vaadin in the context of AJAX and SSR.   Short introduction to Vaadin   The beauty of Vaadin lies in its simplicity - you only write backend code. You read that well. A Vaadin developer only[...]

Augmenting the client with HTMX (2024-10-06)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client to augment the latter. So far, I described the process with Vue.js and Alpine.js. Both are similar from the developers' point of view: they involve JavaScript.   In this post, I&#8217;ll focus on HTMX, whose approach is quite different.   Laying out the work   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as in the previous posts of the series. Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-s[...]

Augmenting the client with Alpine.js (2024-09-29)::
This post is part of a series comparing different ways to implement asynchronous requests on the client, which is colloquially known as AJAX. I dedicated the previous post to Vue.js; I&#8217;ll dedicate this one to Alpine.js - not to be confused with Alpine Linux.   I&#8217;ll follow the same structure as previously.   Laying out the work   Here&#8217;s the setup, server- and client-side.   Server-side  Here is how I integrate Thymeleaf and Alpine.js in the POM:   pom.xml  &lt;dependencies&gt;   [...]

Il est essentiel de suivre le parcours d'une requ√™te √† travers les diff√©rents composants d'un syst√®me distribu√©. Avec l'essor des microservices, cette fonctionnalit√© a atteint un niveau de criticit√© comme jamais auparant. Certains outils propri√©taires de suivi vous sont peut-√™tre connus : Jaeger et Zipkin viennent naturellement √† l'esprit. L'observabilit√© repose sur trois piliers : la journalisation, les m√©triques et le tra√ßage. OpenTelemetry est un effort conjoint visant √† mettre en place un standard ouvert pour ces trois piliers. Jaeger et Zipkin se sont joints √† cet effort et sont maintenant compatibles avec OpenTelemetry. Dans cet expos√©, je d√©crirai plus en d√©tail ce qui pr√©c√®de et je pr√©senterai un cas d'utilisation (simple) pour d√©montrer comment vous pourriez b√©n√©ficier des traces OpenTelemetry dans votre architecture distribu√©e.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

It‚Äôs been said that GitHub is a developer‚Äôs CV. Just a quick look at your commit history and recruiters know all about you. There are a couple of issues with this approach. Most companies don‚Äôt even publish their source code under an Open Source license. If you work for one of them, and if you‚Äôre not a rabid Open Source developer, then it‚Äôs obviously not helpful. Recently, GitHub allowed some degree of customization of one‚Äôs profile. So, even if your commit history has more white than green, you can provide a good entry-point for potential employers. But it‚Äôs only as good as the effort you put in it, and it might decay fast. Yet, with a bit of work, and the help of automation tools (such as GitHub Actions), you can provide an always up-to-date profile. In this talk, I‚Äôll present you how to do it, using my own setup as an example.
