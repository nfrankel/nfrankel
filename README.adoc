Pattern-matching across different languages (2025-07-20)::
Pattern matching is a major feature in software development. While pattern matching applies in several locations, its current usage is limited to switch case blocks. I want to compare the power of pattern matching across a couple of programming languages I&#8217;m familiar with in this post.   I assume that every reader is familiar with the switch case syntax inherited from C. In short:  The switch clause references a value-returning statementEach case clause sets another statement; if the value [...]

Loosely coupled configuration for Home Assistant (2025-07-13)::
This is the 8th post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series. This post will be short, but I hope useful. My home is getting more and more connected, and the number of my automations grow each month. Recently, I equipped my roller shutters with connected Somfy engines so they could roll down automatically when it&#8217;s too hot in summer. Spoiler: given the current heatwave, it&#8217;s a boon![...]

Do You know how to batch? (2025-07-06)::
Concurrent systems face a delicate balance: enabling high throughput under contention while maintaining low latency and predictable behavior. Traditional locking strategies and naive parallelization often introduce performance bottlenecks through cache contention, false sharing, and excessive context switching. These issues are further exacerbated in Cloud and virtualized environments, where performance unpredictability, noisy neighbors, and limited control over physical resources introduce addit[...]

https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-kansas-city/program/nicolas-fr%c3%a4nkel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.kcdc.info/[Kansas City Developer Conference^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
