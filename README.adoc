A short history of AJAX and SSR (2024-09-08)::
My journey in programming began over two decades ago, a time when JavaScript was a far cry from its current state, and developers were primarily focused on Microsoft Internet Explorer. One of my proudest achievements back then was writing a few lines of code that allowed users to add and remove table rows entirely on the client side. We called it DHTML. Many developers today have forgotten about it‚Äîor never knew it existed.   A few years later, AJAX emerged, revolutionizing the way we approached [...]

DRY your Apache APISIX config (2024-09-01)::
DRY is an important principle in software development. This post will show you how to apply it to Apache APISIX configuration.   The DRY principle     'Don&#8217;t repeat yourself' (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.    &#8212; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Wiki[...]

https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-vilnius/program/nicolas-frankel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.devopsdays.org/[DevOps Days Vilnius^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://javaforumnord.de/2024/speaker/[Evolving Your APIs, a Step-By-Step Approach^] @ https://javaforumnord.de/[Java Forum Nord^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
