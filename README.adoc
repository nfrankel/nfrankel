Keeping your fonts in embedded SVG (2024-01-21)::
Last year, I started to use Excalidraw as a diagram tool. However, the SVG images didn&#8217;t display the font correctly. In this post, I&#8217;d like to explain the problem and offer a solution.   Let&#8217;s create a sample drawing with Excalidraw. If you open the link, it should look something like this:      However, in a browser, it looks like this:      The code is straightforward:    &lt;img src='/path/to/sample.svg'&gt;    The font doesn&#8217;t display correctly. The problem is that the[...]

Kicking the tires of Docker Scout (2024-01-14)::
I never moved away from Docker Desktop. For some time, after you use it to build an image, it prints a message:    What's Next?   View a summary of image vulnerabilities and recommendations ‚Üí docker scout quickview    I decided to give it a try. I&#8217;ll use the root commit of my OpenTelemetry tracing demo. Let&#8217;s execute the proposed command:    docker scout quickview otel-catalog:1.0    Here&#8217;s the result:        ‚úì Image stored for indexing     ‚úì Indexed 272 packages   Target       [...]

2023 in retrospective (2024-01-07)::
Last year, I wrote my first yearly retrospective. I liked the experience, so I&#8217;m trying one more time. Let the future decide if it will become a trend or not.   Before diving into our safe technological world, my thoughts go to Ukraine, to my friends who had to flee their own country, to other friends who fought on the front to defend it from an imperial power, and to all victims of an old kleptocrat who clings to power despite the cost to others. The free world needs to support Ukraine mor[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
