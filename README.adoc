Exploring the OpenTelemetry Collector (2023-11-12)::
The OpenTelemetry Collector sits at the center of the OpenTelemetry architecture but is unrelated to the W3C Trace Context. In my tracing demo, I use Jaeger instead of the Collector. Yet, it‚Äôs ubiquitous, as in every OpenTelemetry-related post. I wanted to explore it further. In this post, I explore the different aspects of the Collector: The data kind: logs, metrics, and tracesPush and pull modelsOperations: reads, transformations, and writes First steps A long time ago, observabilit[...]

API versioning (2023-11-05)::
In my previous post Evolving your APIs, I mention the main API versioning approaches. During the talk of the same name, I sometimes get some questions on the subject. In this post, I‚Äôll detail each of them. I assume readers know the reasons behind versioning, semantic versioning, and product lifecycle. If not, I encourage you to read a bit about these themes; in particular, chapter 24 of the excellent API Design Patterns book focuses on them. I‚Äôll summarize the subject in a few wo[...]

Feedback from calling Rust from Python (2023-10-29)::
I got plenty of feedback on my post about Calling Rust from Python: Hacker News/r/python/r/rust Many comments mentioned pyo3, and I should use it instead of cooking my own. Thanks to the authors, I checked: in this post, I explain what it is and how I migrated my code. What is pyo3? Rust bindings for Python, including tools for creating native Python extension modules. Running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary is also supported. ‚Äî PyO3 user guide Indeed, pyo3[...]

In today's interconnected world, organizations face a significant challenge: ensuring compliance with evolving data residency requirements while harnessing the transformative potential of globalized data. Data residency, the concept of where data is physically stored, has become a critical concern due to increasing regulatory demands and privacy concerns. As organizations expand their operations across borders, they encounter a myriad of legal and operational hurdles, necessitating a fresh perspective on managing data across jurisdictions. This talk aims to provide a couple of solutions to solve this problem, with pros and cons. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and the potential path forward to embrace globalized data securely.

Il est crucial de suivre le flux d'une requ√™te √† travers les diff√©rents composants des syst√®mes distribu√©s. Avec l'essor des microservices, leur importance a atteint un niveau critique. Certains outils propri√©taires de suivi ont d√©j√† √©t√© utilis√©s : Jaeger et Zipkin viennent naturellement √† l'esprit. L'observabilit√© repose sur trois piliers : la journalisation, les m√©triques et le tra√ßage. OpenTelemetry est un effort conjoint visant √† mettre en place un standard ouvert pour ces trois piliers. Jaeger et Zipkin se sont joints √† cet effort et sont maintenant compatibles avec OpenTelemetry Dans cet expos√©, je d√©crirai plus en d√©tail ce qui pr√©c√®de et je pr√©senterai un cas d'utilisation (simple) pour d√©montrer comment vous pourriez b√©n√©ficier d'OpenTelemetry dans vos architectures distribu√©es.

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.
