Canary releases with Apache APISIX (2023-12-03)::
In a few words, the idea of canary releases is to deliver a new software version to only a fraction of the users, analyze the results, and decide whether to proceed further or not. If results are not aligned with expectations, roll back; if they are, increase the number of users exposed until all users benefit from the new version.   In this post, I‚Äôd like to detail this introduction briefly, explain different ways to define the fraction, and show how to execute it with Apache APISIX.   Int[...]

Chopping the monolith in a smarter way (2023-11-26)::
In my previous post Chopping the Monolith, I explained that some parts of a monolith are pretty stable and only the fast-changing parts are worth being 'chopped.' I turned the post into a talk and presented it at several conferences. I think it‚Äôs pretty well received; I believe it‚Äôs because most developers understand, or have direct experience, that microservices are not a good fit for traditional organizations, as per Conway‚Äôs Law.   In the talk, I use an e-commerce webapp as a[...]

A retrospective on Errors Management: where do we go from here? (2023-11-19)::
Error management is a fact of life in software development as it is often inevitable and generated by different causes that also include incorrect or incomplete understanding of the requirements or even lack of knowledge of some tools or elements used during development.   Let‚Äôs go on a small trip into the evolutions and different concepts related to error management, analyzing why it is difficult and why we are going in new directions after the moment of Exceptions in programming languages[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
