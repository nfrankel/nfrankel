A short history of AJAX and SSR (2024-09-08)::
My journey in programming began over two decades ago, a time when JavaScript was a far cry from its current state, and developers were primarily focused on Microsoft Internet Explorer. One of my proudest achievements back then was writing a few lines of code that allowed users to add and remove table rows entirely on the client side. We called it DHTML. Many developers today have forgotten about it‚Äîor never knew it existed.   A few years later, AJAX emerged, revolutionizing the way we approached [...]

DRY your Apache APISIX config (2024-09-01)::
DRY is an important principle in software development. This post will show you how to apply it to Apache APISIX configuration.   The DRY principle     'Don&#8217;t repeat yourself' (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.    &#8212; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Wiki[...]

https://devopsstage.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel-2/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devopsstage.com/[DevOps Stage^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://conferences.isaqb.org/software-architecture-gathering/program-2024/#make-your-security-policy-auditable[Make Your Security Policy Auditable^] @ http://2018.javacro.hr/eng/[JavaCro^]::
+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.
