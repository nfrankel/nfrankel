Augmenting the client with Vue.js (2024-09-22)::
In my previous post, I laid the ground to build upon; now is the time to start 'for real'.   I heard a lot of Vue.js. Additionally, a friend who transitioned from developer to manager told me good things about Vue, which further piqued my interest. I decided to have a look at it: it will be the first 'lightweight' JavaScript framework I&#8217;ll study - from the point of view of a newbie, which I am.   Laying out the work   I explained WebJars and Thymeleaf in the last post. Here&#8217;s the setu[...]

Server-Side Rendering with Spring Boot (2024-09-15)::
Understanding the shared steps in the project setup is crucial before delving into the specifics of each client-augmenting technology. My requirements from the last post where quite straightforward:    I&#8217;ll assume the viewpoint of a backend developerNo front-end build step: no TypeScript, no minification, etc.All dependencies are managed from the backend app, i.e., Maven    It&#8217;s important to note that the technology I&#8217;ll be detailing, except Vaadin, follows a similar approach.

https://devopsstage.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel-2/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://devopsstage.com/[DevOps Stage^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
All mature tech stacks nowadays offer infrastructure-related capabilities, either a standard lib or in 3rd-party libraries, e.g., rate-limiting and authorization. While it‚Äôs great to have such features, it‚Äôs impossible to audit them easily. You‚Äôd need to be familiar with the stack and dive deep into the code. This approach just doesn‚Äôt scale, A well-designed system keeps the right feature at the right place. In this talk, I‚Äôll go through all steps toward making your system more easily auditable. I‚Äôll use the authorization of a security policy as an example and start from a regular Spring Boot project with Spring Security. I‚Äôll then move step-by-step, introducing the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the Apache APISIX API Gateway. The end result will have moved all authorization details buried in the code in a readable accessible place.
