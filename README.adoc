Improving my previous OpenRewrite recipe (2025-06-15)::
I started discovering OpenRewrite last week by writing a Kotlin recipe that moves Kotlin files according to the official directory structure recommendation. I mentioned some future works, and here they are. In this post, I want to describe how to compute the root package instead of letting the user set it.   Reminder   I developed last week a recipe to follow the Kotlin recommendation regarding directory structure:     In pure Kotlin projects, the recommended directory structure follows the packa[...]

OpenRewrite recipes (2025-06-08)::
I&#8217;ve been eying OpenRewrite for some time, but I haven&#8217;t had time to play with it yet. In case you never heard about OpenRewrite, OpenRewrite takes care of refactoring your codebase to newer language, framework, and paradigm versions.   Using OpenRewrite is pretty straightforward. It already provides a large corpus of existing recipes, some of which are free. What I find amazingly powerful is the ability to author new recipes. I decided to learn about it and write my own in this serie[...]

Authoring an OpenRewrite recipe (2025-06-08)::
I&#8217;ve been eying OpenRewrite for some time, but I haven&#8217;t had time to play with it yet. In case you never heard about OpenRewrite, OpenRewrite takes care of refactoring your codebase to newer language, framework, and paradigm versions.     OpenRewrite is an open-source automated refactoring ecosystem for source code, enabling developers to effectively eliminate technical debt within their repositories.   It consists of an auto-refactoring engine that runs prepackaged, open-source refac[...]

## üó£Ô∏è Upcoming talks



https://mobile.devoxx.com/events/voxxedlu2025/talks/1306/details[End-to-End Pull Request Testing on Kubernetes: A Walkthrough^] @ https://voxxeddays.com/luxembourg/[Voxxed Days Luxembourg^]::
+
As applications increasingly rely on Kubernetes for deployment, ensuring seamless integration and end-to-end testing during pull requests is crucial. This talk dives into the practical steps of building a robust CI/CD pipeline that mirrors production environments, enabling reliable and efficient testing within your Kubernetes ecosystem. We‚Äôll explore how to: * Set up foundational unit and integration tests using modern tools like Testcontainers and GitHub Workflows. * Integrate Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to emulate a production-grade cluster for testing.
 * Isolate test environments, ensuring parallel runs and minimizing interference.
* Attendees will gain actionable insights to create scalable and maintainable testing pipelines via an existing working example.

https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-kansas-city/program/nicolas-fr%c3%a4nkel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.kcdc.info/[Kansas City Developer Conference^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
