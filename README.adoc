Introduction to the Tower library (2023-08-20)::
One of the components of my OpenTelemetry demo is a Rust application built with the Axum web framework. In its description, axum mentions: axum doesn‚Äôt have its own middleware system but instead uses tower::Service. This means axum gets timeouts, tracing, compression, authorization, and more, for free. It also enables you to share middleware with applications written using hyper or tonic. ‚Äî axum README So far, I was happy to let this cryptic explanation lurk in the corner of[...]

Ops friendly Apache APISIX (2023-08-13)::
Though I always worked on the Dev side of IT, I was also interested in the Ops side. I even had a short experience being a WebSphere admin: I used it several times, helping Ops deal with the Admin console while being a developer. Providing a single package that Ops can configure and deploy in different environments is very important. As a JVM developer, I‚Äôve been happy using Spring Boot and its wealth of configuration options: command-line parameters, JVM parameters, files, profiles, enviro[...]

My final take on Gradle (vs. Maven) (2023-08-06)::
I tweet technical content that I consider interesting, but the funny tweets are the ones that get the most engagement. I attended the JavaLand conference in March, stumbled upon the Gradle booth, and found this gem: Things have changed a lot üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ÄúWhen you can‚Äôt beat them, join them‚Äù pic.twitter.com/SnX3KN57o8‚Äî Nicolas Frankel üá∫üá¶ (@nicolas_frankel) March 22, 2023 Of course, at some point, a fanboy hijacked the thread and claimed the so-called superiority of Gradle.

https://www.devupconf.org/speakers/nicolas-fr%C3%A4nkel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.devupconf.org/[dev up^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture. 


https://www.devupconf.org/speakers/nicolas-fr%C3%A4nkel[Evolving your APIs, a step-by-step approach^] @ https://www.devupconf.org/[dev up^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.


https://www.devupconf.org/speakers/nicolas-fr%C3%A4nkel[Chopping the monolith^] @ https://www.devupconf.org/[dev up^]::

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.
