Even more Opentelemetry! (2024-06-02)::
I continue to work on my Opentelemetry demo. Its main idea is to showcase traces across various technology stacks, including asynchronous communication via an MQTT queue. This week, I added a couple of components and changed the architecture. Here are some noteworthy learnings; note that some of them might not be entirely connected to OpenTelemetry.   Here&#8217;s an updated diagram. New components appear in violet, and updated components appear in green.        I want to be able to add more comp[...]

Parsing structured environment variables in Rust (2024-05-26)::
I&#8217;m in the process of adding more components to my OpenTelemetry demo (again!). The new design deploys several warehouse services behind the inventory service so the latter can query the former for data via their respective HTTP interface. I implemented each warehouse on top of a different technology stack. This way, I can show OpenTelemetry traces across several stacks.   Anyone should be able to add a warehouse in their favorite tech stack if it returns the correct JSON payload to the inv[...]

Workflow, from stateless to stateful (2024-05-19)::
A (long) time ago, my first job consisted of implementing workflows using the Staffware engine. In short, a workflow comprises tasks; an automated task delegates to code, while a manual task requires somebody to do something and mark it as done. Then, it proceeds to the next task - or tasks. Here&#8217;s a sample workflow:      The above diagram uses Business Process Model and Notation. You can now design your workflow using BPMN and run it with compatible workflow engines.   Time has passed. Sta[...]

https://devfest.gdglille.org/speaker-page-nicolas-frankel/[Faire √©voluer vos APIs HTTP, une approche pas-√†-pas^] @ https://devfest.gdglille.org/[DevFest Lille^]::
+
Lorsque vous publiez votre premi√®re API HTTP, vous avez tendance √† vous concentrer davantage sur les probl√©matiques √† court terme que sur l'avenir. Cependant, il y a des chances que votre application rencontre du succ√®s. La question se pose alors : comment faire √©voluer votre API sans rompre le contrat avec vos utilisateurs existants ? Dans cette pr√©sentation, je vous montrerai quelques trucs et astuces pour y parvenir : d√©placer vos points de terminaison, les d√©pr√©cier, surveiller qui les utilise et informer les utilisateurs des nouveaux points de terminaison. La pr√©sentation est bas√©e sur une d√©mo et j'utiliserai le projet Apache APISIX pour cela.

When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
