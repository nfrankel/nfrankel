Are you really wasting your time in Java without these 10 libraries? (2025-11-16)::
I recently read and shared You’re Wasting Time in Java Without These 10 Libraries. I commented on it a bit in my newsletter, but given the amount and intensity of reactions, I think a full-blown post is in order. The referenced libraries are:  Project LombokMapStructJUnit 5 &amp; MockitoSLF4J with LogbackApache Commons Lang &amp; Google GuavaJacksonHibernate ValidatorSpring FrameworkApache HttpClient / OkHttpLiquibase or Flyway  Lombok     Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs[...]

Choosing a dependency (2025-11-02)::
Fun fact, I thought I had already written this post, but when I wanted to reference it, I found out that I didn&#8217;t.

https://yowcon.com/melbourne-2025/sessions/3613/webassembly-on-kubernetes[WebAssembly on Kubernetes^] @ https://yowcon.com/melbourne-2025[YOW! Melbourne^]::
+
WebAssembly started as a technology tailored to web browsers and is becoming popular as a server-side technology as well. The next step is for Wasm to become a powerful tool for cloud-native applications. When combined with Kubernetes, WebAssembly can revolutionize application deployment, security, and resource efficiency in ways traditional containers cannot. This talk explores why and how to leverage WebAssembly within Kubernetes environments to create scalable, high-performance, and secure applications.
