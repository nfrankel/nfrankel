Error management in Rust, and libs that support it (2024-02-11)::
As part of learning the Rust ecosystem, I dedicated the last few days to error management. Here are my findings.   Error management 101   The Rust book describes the basics of error management. The language separates between recoverable errors and unrecoverable ones.   Unrecoverable errors benefit from the panic!() macro. When Rust panics, it stops the program. Recoverable errors are much more enjoyable.   Rust uses the Either monad, which stems from Functional Programming. Opposite to exceptions[...]

Hardening Apache APISIX with the OWASP's Coraza and Core Ruleset (2024-02-04)::
The OWASP stands for Open Worldwide Application Security Project:     The Open Worldwide Application Security Project is an online community that produces freely available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the fields of IoT, system software and web application security. The OWASP provides free and open resources. It is led by a non-profit called The OWASP Foundation. The OWASP Top 10 - 2021 is the published result of recent research based on comprehensive data com[...]

Improving upon my OpenTelemetry Tracing demo (2024-01-28)::
Last year, I wrote a post on Open Telemetry Tracing to understand more about the subject. I also created a demo around it, which featured the following components:  The Apache APISIX API GatewayA Kotlin/Spring Boot serviceA Python/Flask serviceAnd a Rust/Axum service  I&#8217;ve recently improved the demo to deepen my understanding and want to share my learning.   Using a regular database   In the initial demo, I didn&#8217;t bother with a regular database. Instead:  The Kotlin service used the e[...]

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
