For once, I‚Äôm wondering a bit if this post can be helpful to somebody else. I believe my context is pretty specific. Anyway, just in case it might be the case, here it is. My Jet Train project makes use of GTFS. GTFS stands for General Transit Feed Specification. It models public transportation schedules and their associated geographic information. GTFS is based on two kinds of data, static data, and dynamic data. Static data may change but do so rarely, e.g., transit agencies and bus s[...]

Rust's Vector (2021-08-08)::
This is the 9th post in the Start Rust focus series. I‚Äôll be honest: I initially wanted to describe all collections available in Rust as well as their related concepts.

GitLab as your Continuous Deployment one-stop shop (2021-08-01)::
This week, I want to take a break from my Start Rust series and focus on a different subject. I‚Äôve already written about my blogging stack in detail. However, I didn‚Äôt touch into one facet, and that facet is how I generate the static pages from Jekyll. As I describe in the blog post, I‚Äôve included quite a couple of customizations.

CDC is a brand new approach that ‚Äúturns the database inside out‚Äù: it allows to get events out of the database state. This can be leveraged to get a cache that is never stale.

https://codepalousa.com/Sessions/2058[A Guided Tour of Caching Patterns^] @ https://codepalousa.com/[Code PaLOUsa^]::
+
You might have been using cache for years, and still always design the application to be responsible for the sync between the cache and the underlying data store. Did you know there are many more options available?

https://geekle.us/qa_volume2[Mutation Testing to the Rescue of your Tests^] @ null[QA Global Summit^]::
+
Code coverage is useless because of assertless testing. There‚Äôs a technique to replace it, it‚Äôs called Mutation Testing.
