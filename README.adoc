Default map value (2024-08-11)::
In this post, I&#8217;ll explain how to provide a default value when querying an absent key in a hash map in different programming languages.   Java   Let&#8217;s start with Java, my first professional programming language.   In older versions, retrieving a value from a map required using the get() method:    Map map = new HashMap();                                 (1) Object value = map.get(new Object());                    (2) if (value == null) {     value = 'default';                         [...]

OpenTelemetry Tracing on Spring Boot, Java Agent vs. Micrometer Tracing (2024-08-04)::
My demo of OpenTelemetry Tracing features two Spring Boot components. One uses the Java agent, and I noticed a different behavior when I recently upgraded it from v1.x to v2.x. In the other one, I&#8217;m using Micrometer Tracing because I compile to GraalVM native, and it can&#8217;t process Java agents.   I want to compare these three different ways in this post: Java agent v1, Java agent v2, and Micrometer Tracing.   The base application and its infrastructure   I&#8217;ll use the same base ap[...]

Free tier API with Apache APISIX (2024-07-28)::
Lots of service providers offer a free tier of their service. The idea is to let you kick their service&#8217;s tires freely. If you need to go above the free tier at any point, you&#8217;ll likely stay on the service and pay. In this day and age, most services are online and accessible via an API. Today, we will implement a free tier with Apache APISIX.   A naive approach   I implemented a free tier in my post Evolving your RESTful APIs, a step-by-step approach, albeit in a very naive way. I cop[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
