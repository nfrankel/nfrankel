Python "magic" methods (2023-10-15)::
Python provides specially-named methods: methods that the runtime interprets in a certain way, but that you need to know about. The documentation is pretty exhaustive about them, but it needs examples for beginners. The goal of this two-part series is to list these methods and provide these examples, so that I can remember them. Part 1Part 2[...]

Python "magic" methods - part 1 (2023-10-15)::
Java was the first language I used professionally and is the scale by which I measure other languages I learned afterward. It‚Äôs an OOP statically-typed language. Hence, Python feels a bit weird because of its dynamic typing approach. For example, Object offers methods equals(), hashCode(), and toString(). Because all other classes inherit from Object, directly or indirectly, all objects have these methods by definition. Conversely, Python was not initially built on OOP principles and is[...]

A Java Geek weekly, Issue 1 (2023-10-11)::
If you‚Äôre subscribed to my Twitter feed, you might have noticed that I don‚Äôt post as much content as before. It was a good place, once, but I cannot condone the new management and most importantly, their handling of misinformation - or lack thereof. My reasoning is that if I continue posting technical content there, people will continue using it; if nobody posts such content, regular users will leave the site. You might agree or not, but since it‚Äôs my content, it‚Äôs now how[...]

https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/alpesjug/events/296768878/[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ http://www.alpesjug.org/[Alpes JUG^]::
+
Tracer le parcours d'une requ√™te au travers de diff√©rents composants d'un syst√®me distribu√© est essentiel. Avec l'apparition des micro-services, ce besoin a atteint des niveaux critiques. Certains outils propri√©taires pour suivre ce parcours sont d√©j√† utilis√©s: parmi les plus c√©l√®bres Jaeger et Zipkin viennent rapidement √† l'esprit. L'observabilit√© est construite autour de trois piliers: les logs, les m√©triques et les traces. OpenTelemetry est un effort partag√© pour propos√© un standard ouvert couvrant ces trois points. Jaeger et Zipkin en font partie et fournissent une impl√©mentation compatible OpenTelemetry. Durant cette pr√©sentation, je vous d√©crirai tout cela en d√©tails et je vous pr√©senterai un cas d'usage (simple) pour vous montrer comment vous pourrez b√©n√©ficier d'OpenTelemetry dans vos architectures distribu√©es.


https://2023.geecon.cz/speakers/[Data Residency: the fun of storing data worldwide^] @ https://2018.geecon.cz/[GeeCon Prague^]::
+
In today's interconnected world, organizations face a significant challenge: ensuring compliance with evolving data residency requirements while harnessing the transformative potential of globalized data. Data residency, the concept of where data is physically stored, has become a critical concern due to increasing regulatory demands and privacy concerns. As organizations expand their operations across borders, they encounter a myriad of legal and operational hurdles, necessitating a fresh perspective on managing data across jurisdictions. This talk aims to provide a couple of solutions to solve this problem, with pros and cons. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face and the potential path forward to embrace globalized data securely. 


https://nordicapis.com/speakers/nicolas-frankel/[Evolving Your APIs, a Step-By-Step Approach^] @ https://nordicapis.com/events/[Platform Summit^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
