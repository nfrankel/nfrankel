Improving upon my OpenTelemetry Tracing demo (2024-01-28)::
Last year, I wrote a post on Open Telemetry Tracing to understand more about the subject. I also created a demo around it, which featured the following components:  The Apache APISIX API GatewayA Kotlin/Spring Boot serviceA Python/Flask serviceAnd a Rust/Axum service  I&#8217;ve recently improved the demo to deepen my understanding and want to share my learning.   Using a regular database   In the initial demo, I didn&#8217;t bother with a regular database. Instead:  The Kotlin service used the e[...]

Keeping your fonts in embedded SVG (2024-01-21)::
Last year, I started to use Excalidraw as a diagram tool. However, the SVG images didn&#8217;t display the font correctly. In this post, I&#8217;d like to explain the problem and offer a solution.   Let&#8217;s create a sample drawing with Excalidraw. If you open the link, it should look something like this:      However, in a browser, it looks like this:      The code is straightforward:    &lt;img src='/path/to/sample.svg'&gt;    The font doesn&#8217;t display correctly. The problem is that the[...]

Il est essentiel de suivre le parcours d'une requ√™te √† travers les diff√©rents composants d'un syst√®me distribu√©. Avec l'essor des microservices, cette fonctionnalit√© a atteint un niveau de criticit√© comme jamais auparant. Certains outils propri√©taires de suivi vous sont peut-√™tre connus : Jaeger et Zipkin viennent naturellement √† l'esprit. L'observabilit√© repose sur trois piliers : la journalisation, les m√©triques et le tra√ßage. OpenTelemetry est un effort conjoint visant √† mettre en place un standard ouvert pour ces trois piliers. Jaeger et Zipkin se sont joints √† cet effort et sont maintenant compatibles avec OpenTelemetry. Dans cet expos√©, je d√©crirai plus en d√©tail ce qui pr√©c√®de et je pr√©senterai un cas d'utilisation (simple) pour d√©montrer comment vous pourriez b√©n√©ficier des traces OpenTelemetry dans votre architecture distribu√©e.

Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure. There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In "the past", we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service. In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.
