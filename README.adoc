Free tier API with Apache APISIX (2024-07-28)::
Lots of service providers offer a free tier of their service. The idea is to let you kick their service&#8217;s tires freely. If you need to go above the free tier at any point, you&#8217;ll likely stay on the service and pay. In this day and age, most services are online and accessible via an API. Today, we will implement a free tier with Apache APISIX.   A naive approach   I implemented a free tier in my post Evolving your RESTful APIs, a step-by-step approach, albeit in a very naive way. I cop[...]

Differentiating rate limits in Apache APISIX (2024-07-21)::
In my talk Evolving your APIs, I mention that an API Gateways is a Reverse Proxy 'on steroids'. One key difference between the former and the latter is that the API Gateway is not unfriendly to business logic. The poster child is rate-limiting.   Rate-limiting is an age-old Reverse Proxy feature focused on protecting against DDoS attacks. It treats all clients the same and is purely technical. In this day and age, most API providers offer different subscription tiers; the higher the tier, the hig[...]

Advanced URL rewriting with Apache APISIX (2024-07-14)::
I spoke at Swiss PgDay in Switzerland in late June. The talk was about how to create a no-code API with the famous PostgreSQL database, the related PostgREST, and Apache APISIX, of course. I already wrote about the idea in a previous post. However, I wanted to improve it, if only slightly.   PostgREST offers a powerful SELECT mechanism. To list all entities with a column equal to a value, you need the following command:    curl /products?id=eq.1   id is the columneq.1 corresponds to the WHERE cla[...]

Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.

+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
