DRY your Apache APISIX config (2024-09-01)::
DRY is an important principle in software development. This post will show you how to apply it to Apache APISIX configuration.   The DRY principle     'Don&#8217;t repeat yourself' (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.    &#8212; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Wiki[...]

When (not) to write an Apache APISIX plugin (2024-08-25)::
When I introduce Apache APISIX in my talks, I mention the massive number of existing plugins, and that each of them implements a specific feature. One of the key features of Apache APISIX is its flexibility. If a feature is missing, you can create your own plugin in Lua or a language compiled into Wasm, showcasing the platform&#8217;s adaptability to your specific needs. In this post, I aim to provide practical alternatives to writing a custom plugin, offering solutions you can quickly implement [...]

Kotlin Coroutines and OpenTelemetry tracing (2024-08-18)::
I recently compared three OpenTelemetry approaches on the JVM: Java Agent v1, v2, and Micrometer. I used Kotlin and coroutines without overthinking. I received interesting feedback on the usage of @WithSpan with coroutines:  Nice one..by the way to instrument the coroutine context properly, don&#39;t we need &quot;opentelemetry-extension-kotlin&quot; also? Without that, spans are not recorded properly for suspend functions (https://t.co/DSgJklnllD) pic.twitter.com/5wDwhYhoDM&mdash; Suresh G (@sur[...]

https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-vilnius/program/nicolas-frankel[Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing^] @ https://www.devopsdays.org/[DevOps Days Vilnius^]::
+
Tracking a request‚Äôs flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind. Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible. In this talk, I‚Äôll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture.



https://javaforumnord.de/2024/speaker/[Evolving Your APIs, a Step-By-Step Approach^] @ https://javaforumnord.de/[Java Forum Nord^]::
+
When you publish your first HTTP API, you‚Äôre more focused on short-term issues than planning for the future. However, chances are you‚Äôll be successful, and you‚Äôll hit the wall. How do you evolve your API without breaking the contract with your existing users? In this talk, I‚Äôll first show you some tips and tricks to achieve that: moving your endpoints, deprecating them, monitoring who‚Äôs using them, and letting users know about the new endpoints. The talk is demo-based, and I‚Äôll use the Apache APISIX project for it.
